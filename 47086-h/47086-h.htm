<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="p2">Upon the Christmas morning the parish flocked
to church, and the church was dressed so beautifully
that every one was amazed. Amy and Eoa made
the wreaths, the garlands, and rosettes; there was
only one cross out of the lot, a badly&ndash;bred Maltese
one; and Eoa walked over the barbarous pewscreens
(like the travisses in a stable), springing
from one to another, with a cable of flowers and
evergreens, as easily and calmly as she would come
down&ndash;stairs to dinner. Of course she had never
heard of that sort of thing before, but she took to
it at once, as she did to anything pretty; and soon
she was Amyʼs mistress, as indeed she must be
every oneʼs, unless she could not bear them.</p>

<p>The sons of the Forest looked up with amazement
as they shambled in one after other, and an
old woodcutter went home for his axe, lest the ivy
should throttle the pillars. On the whole, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
parish attributed this great outburst of foliage to
the indignation of the pixies at Parson Johnʼs
going to London, and staying there so long.</p>

<p>The prayers were read by Mr. Pell, for the
rector was weary and languid; but he would not
forego his pleasant words to the well&ndash;known flock
that day. While the choir was making a stupendous
din out of something they called an
“anthem,” Octave slipped off to his Rushford
duty, through the chancel&ndash;door. Then, with his
silken gown on&mdash;given him years ago by subscription,
and far too grand for him to wear, except at
Christmas and Easter&mdash;John Rosedew mounted the
pulpit&ndash;stairs, and showed (as in a holy bower of
good&ndash;will and of gratitude) the loving&ndash;kindness of
his face and the grandeur of his forehead. As he
glanced from one to the other with a general welcome,
a genial interest in the welfare both of soul
and body, a stir and thrill ran through the church,
and many eyes were tearful. For already a rumour
was abroad that “Uncle John” must leave them,
that another Christmas Day would see a stranger in
his pulpit.</p>

<p>After dwelling briefly on his favourite subject,
Christian love, and showing (by quotations from
the noblest of heathen philosophers) how low and
false their standard was, how poor a keystone is
earthly citizenship, the patriotism of a pugnacious
village, or a little presumptuous Attica, to crown
and bind together the great arch of humanity;
after showing, too, with a depth of learning wasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
on his audience, how utterly false the assertion is
that the doctrines, or rather the principles, nay, the
one great principle of our New Testament, had
ever been anticipated on the banks of the Yellow
River&mdash;eloquently he turned himself to the application
of his subject.</p>

<p>With some unconscious yearning perhaps, or
perhaps some sense of home&ndash;truth, he gazed towards
the curtained pew where sat his ancient
friend, brought thither (it was too evident) by
tidings of his absence. As the eyes of the old men
met, for the first time after long estrangement&mdash;those
eyes that had met so frankly and kindly for
more than fifty years, during all which time each
to the other had been a “necessarius”&mdash;and as
each observed how pale and grey his veteran comrade
looked, neither heart was wholly free from
self&ndash;reproach and sorrow.</p>

<p>John Rosedewʼs mild eyes glistened so, and his
voice so shook and faltered, that all the parish
noticed it, and wondered what harm it had done
last week. For none of them had ever known his
voice shake, except when some parishioner had
done the unbecoming; and then the village mourned
it, because it vexed the parson so.</p>

<p>The next day, as soon as Parson John had found
that all parochial matters were in proper trim, and
that he might leave home again without neglect of
duty, what did he do but order a fly, no less than
a one&ndash;horse fly, from the “Jolly Foresters;” which
fly should rush to the parsonage&ndash;door, as nearly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
might be, at one oʼclock? Now why would not
Coræbus suffice to carry the rector and valise,
according to the laws of the Medes and Persians,
a distance of two parasangs?</p>

<p>Simply because our Amy was going, and had
every right to go. Beautiful Amy was going to
London, great fountain&ndash;head of all visions and
marvels, even from white long&ndash;clothes up to the
era of striped crinoline. And who shall object,
except on the ground that Amy was too good
to go?</p>

<p>If Amy were put down now in Hyde Park, Piccadilly,
or Regent&ndash;street, at the height and cream of
the season, when fop, and screw, and fogey, Frivolus
and Frivola, Diana Venatrix, Copa Syrisca,
Aphrodite Misthote, yea, and even some natural
honest girls moderately ticketed, are doing their
caravaning&mdash;if Amy were put on the pathway
there, in her simple grey hat and feather, and that
roundabout chenille thing which she herself had
made, and which followed the lines of her figure
so, fifty fellows, themselves of the most satisfactory
figure (at Drummondʼs, or at Couttsʼs), fifty fellows
who had slipped the hook fifty times apiece
(spite of motherly bend OʼShaugnessey) must
have received their stroke of grace, and hated
Cradock Nowell.</p>

<p>Although the South&ndash;Western Railway had been
open so many years, our forest&ndash;child had never
been further from green leaf and yellow gorse
than Winchester in the eastern hemisphere, and
Salisbury in the western. And now after all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
think that she was going to London, not for joy,
but sorrow. Desperate coaxing it had cost; every
known or new device&mdash;transparent every one of
them, as the pleading eyes that urged it&mdash;every bit
of cozening learned from three years old and upward,
every girlish argument that never can hold
water, unless it be a tear&ndash;drop; and, better than a
million pleas, every soft caress and kiss, all loving,
all imploring&mdash;there was not one of these but
came to batter Amyʼs father, or ever he surrendered.
For Johnʼs ideas were very old&ndash;fashioned
as to maidenly decorum, and Aunt Eudoxiaʼs view
of the matter was even more prim and grim than
his. Yet (as Amy well remarked) if <i>she</i> could see
no harm in it, there certainly could be none; and
how could they insist so much on the <i>καλόν</i> and the
<i>πρέπον</i>, as if they over&ndash;rode <i>τὸ δέον</i>!</p>

<p>It is likely enough that this last stroke won the
palm of victory; for, though Miss Amy knew
little of Greek, and her father knew a great deal,
she often contrived, with true feminine skill, to
take his wicket neatly, before he had found his
block&ndash;hole. And then her father would smile and
chuckle, and ask to have his bat again; which
never was allowed him. To think that any man
should be the father of such <i>ἐυστοχία</i>!</p>

<p>Therefore, that father was compelled to throw
himself, flat as a flounder, on Eudoxiaʼs generosity;
for the leech&ndash;bottle now was dry.</p>

<p>“Darling Doxy, you know quite well you are
such a wonderful manager; you have got a little
cash somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>He put it with a twist of interrogation, a quivering
lever of doubt, and yet a grand fulcrum of
confidence, which were totally irresistible. No
wonder his daughter could coax. Oh that I were
like you, John, when I want a bit of money!</p>

<p>Hereupon Aunt Doxy smiled, with the perception
of superior mind, and the power of causing
astonishment. Never a word she said, but went
to some unknown recesses in holy up&ndash;stair adyta:
she fussed about with many keys, over sounding
boards and creaking ones, to signify her caution;
and at last came back with a leathern bag, wash&ndash;leather
tied with bobbin. Putting up her hands to
keep Amy at a distance, she pursed her lips, as if
to say, “Now donʼt be disappointed; there is
really nothing in it. Nothing, at least, I mean for
people of your extravagant ideas.”</p>

<p>Then, one by one, before Johnʼs eyes, which
enlarged with a geometric progression of amazement,
she laid a gorgeous train of gold, as if it
were but dominoes, beginning with half&ndash;sovereigns
first, then breaking into the broader gauge, until
there must have been twenty pounds, and John
thought of all his poor people. Verily then she
stopped awhile, to enhance her climax; or perhaps
she hesitated, as was only natural. But now
the pleasure of the thing was too much for her
prudence. Looking at John and then at Amy,
and wanting to look at both at once, she drew
from a little niche in the bag, with a jerk (as if it
were nothing) a dainty marrowfat ten&ndash;pound note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the Bank of England, with a name of substance
upon the back, and an authenticity of grease
grander than any water&ndash;mark. She tried very
hard to make light of it, and not wave it in the air
even; but the tide of her heart was too strong for
her, and she turned away, and cried as hard as if
she had no money.</p>

<p>Who may pretend to taste and tell every herb
in the soup of nature? There is no sovereign
moly, no paramount amellus; even basil (the herb
of kings) may be lost in garlic. Blest are they
who seek not ever for the forced&ndash;meat balls, but
find some good in every brewis, homely, burnt, or
overstrained. John Rosedew, putting on his boots
for the road to London, felt himself, at every tug,
quite as rich as Megacles&mdash;that man of foremost
Athenian blood, but none the more a gentleman,
who walked capaciously into, and rapaciously
walked out of, the gold&ndash;granaries of Cr&oelig;sus. A
delightful sense of having gotten great money out
of Eudoxia&mdash;a triumph without historic parallel&mdash;inspired
him, away with that overdone word!&mdash;aerated
him with glory. Thirty pounds, and some
odd shillings, wholly at John Rosedewʼs mercy
(who never gave quarter to money, but hewed it
as small as Agag when anybody asked him),&mdash;thirty
pounds, with no duty upon it, no stamp of
responsibility, and a peculiar and peppery piquancy
in the spending of every halfpenny, to wonder
what sister Doxy would think if she could only
know it! He gave careful Amy the note to keep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and 15<i>l.</i> to go inside it, because he had promised
to do so, for Doxy knew his nature.</p>

<p>In that noble fly from the “Foresters,” which
had only two springs broken, John and his daughter
went away to catch the train at Brockenhurst.
Out of the windows dangerously they pushed their
beautiful heads&mdash;the beauty of youth on one side,
the beauty of age on the other&mdash;although the
coachman had specially warned them that neither
door would fasten. But what could they do, when
Aunt Doxy was there by the great rhododendron,
with a kettle&ndash;holder over her mouth because it was
so cold; fat Jemima too, and Jenny, and Jem Pottles
leading Coræbus to shake off his dust at the
shay&ndash;horse, and learn what he might come to?</p>

<p>Some worthy people had journeyed up from the
further end of the village, to bid an eternal farewell
to Amy, and to take home the washing. They
knew she would never come back again; she would
never be let go again; folks in London were so
wicked, and parson was so innocent. Evil though
the omens were, as timidly blushing she went away,
tearfully leaving her fatherʼs hearth, though a daw
on the left hand forbade her to go, and a wandering
chough was overheard, and a croaking raven
whirled away into the wilds of the woodland&mdash;for
whom shall I fear, I the cannie seer, while Amy
smiles dexter out of the cab, and wraps her faith
around her?</p>

<p>Make we not half our life here, according as we
receive it? Is it not as the rain that falls, softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
when softly taken, as of leaves and grass and
water; but rattling and flying in mud and foul
splashes, when met at wrong angles repulsively?</p>

<p>My little daughter, if you cannot see your way
in that simile&mdash;a very common&ndash;place one,&mdash;take a
still more timeworn and venerable illustration.
Our life is but a thread, my child, at any moment
snappable, though never snapped unwisely; and
true as it is that we cannot spin and shape it (as
does the spider) out of our own emotions, yet we
have this gift of God, that we can secrete some
gold along it, some diamonds fetching the sunlight.
Knowing, then, in whose Hand we are, and feeling
how large that Hand is, let us know and feel
therewith that He will not crush us; that He loves
us to rejoice therein, and tamely to regard Him;
with confidence in adoration, a smile in every bow
to Him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="p2">Polly Ducksacre was sitting in state behind
the little counter, and opposite the gas&ndash;jet, upon
her throne&mdash;a bushel basket set upside down on
another. It was the evening of Boxing Day, and
Polly was arrayed with a splendour that challenged
the strictest appraisement; so gorgeous were her
gilt earrings, cornelian necklace, sham cameo brooch&mdash;Cupid
stealing the sword of Mars&mdash;and German&ndash;silver
bracelets. The children who came in
for “haʼporths of specked” forgot their errand
and hopes of prigging, and, sucking their lips with
wild admiration, cried “Lor now! Ainʼt she
stunnin?” “Spexs her sweetheart in a coach and
four,” exclaimed one little girl of great penetration;
“oh give us a ride, miss, when he comes.”</p>

<p>That little girl was right, to a limited extent.
Polly did expect her sweetheart; not in a coach
and four, however, but in a smallish tax&ndash;cart,
chestnut&ndash;coloured, picked out with white; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
panel whereof was painted, as the Act directs,
“Robert Clinkers, Junior, Coal&ndash;merchant, Hammersmith.”
Mr. Clinkers, whose first visit had
been paid simply from pity for Cradock, and to
acquit himself of all complicity in Hearty Wibrahamʼs
swindle, had called again to make kind inquiries,
after finding how ill the poor fellow was,
and that his landlady sold coals. Nor was it long
before he ventured to propose an arrangement,
mutually beneficial, under which the Ducksacre
firm should receive their supply from him. Two
or three councils were held, but the ladies were
obliged to surrender at last, because he was so
complimentary, and had such nice white teeth, and
spoke in such a feeling manner of his dear departed
angel. On the other hand, their old wharfinger
would come blustering about his sacks, loud
enough to make the potatoes jump, and he kept
such impudent men, and bit his nails without any
manners, and called them both “Mrs. Acreducks.”</p>

<p>During this Clinkerian diplomacy, Polly showed
such shrewdness, and such a nice foot and ancle,
and had such a manner of rolling her eyes&mdash;blacker
and brighter than best Wallsend&mdash;that
the coals of love were laid, the match struck, the
fire kindled, and drawing well up the hearth&ndash;place,
before Robert Clinkers knew what he was at.
And now he came every evening, bringing two
sacks of coal with him, and sat on a bag of Barcelonas,
and cracked, and gazed at Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Ducksacre, you should sell lemonade,’”
he had said only Saturday last, which was Christmas
Eve, “it is such a genteel drink, you know,
when a chap is consumed with internal fires, as
the great poet says&mdash;him as wrote the operas, or
the copperas, bless me, I never know which it is;
likely you can tell, miss?”</p>

<p>“Lor, Mr. Clinkers, why, the proper name is
hopperas; we shows the boards, and we gets a
ticket, when nobody else wonʼt go.”</p>

<p>“Oh now! Do you, though? Ah, I was there,
afore ever I knew what life was. A tricksome
thing is life, Miss Polly, especially for a ‘andsome
female, and no young fellow to be trusted with it.
Valuable cargo on green wood. Sure to come to
shipwreck.”</p>

<p>“Lor, Mr. Clinkers, you donʼt mean <i>me</i>! I am
sure I am not at all handsome.”</p>

<p>“Then there isnʼt one in London, miss. Coals
is coals, and fire is fire&mdash;oh, I should like some
lemonade, with a drop of rum in it. Would you
join me in it now, if I just pop round the corner?
It would make you feel so nice now.”</p>

<p>“Do I ever feel anything else but nice?” Oh,
Polly, what a <i>leading</i> question!</p>

<p>“I wishes it was in my province now, with the
deepest respect, to try!” Here Polly flashed away,
though nobody was pursuing her, got behind some
Penzance broccoli, and seized a half&ndash;pottle to defend
herself. Mr. Clinkers, knowing what he was
about, appealed to a bunch of mistletoe, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which, in distracting distraction, the young lady
had taken refuge.</p>

<p>“Now nobody else in all this London,” said the
coal&ndash;merchant to the berries, “in all this mighty
Baal, as the poet beautifully expresses it, especially
if a young man, not over five&ndash;and&ndash;thirty, not so
very bad&ndash;looking but experienced in life, and with
great veneration for females, and a business, you
may say, of three hundred a year clear of income&ndash;tax
and increasing yearly, and a contract with the
company, without no encumbrances, would ever
go to think of letting that beautiful young lady
enjoy the sweets of retirement in that most initing
position, without plucking some of the pearls
off, and no harm done or taken. And nothing at
all pervents me, no consideration of the brockolo&mdash;could
pay for it to&ndash;morrow morning&mdash;but my
deepest respects, not having my best togs on,
through a cruel haxident. Please pigs theyʼll come
home to&ndash;morrow morning, and Iʼll do it on Monday,
and lock up yard at four oʼclock, if tailor has made
a job of it. Look nice indeed, and feel nice? I
should like to know how she could help it!”</p>

<p>This explains why, when the wheels at the door
proved to be not of the sprightly tax&ndash;cart, but a
lumbering cab, Polly was disappointed. Neither
was her displeasure removed when she saw a very
pretty girl get out, and glide into the shop, with
the loveliest damask spreading over the softest and
clearest cheeks. Though Polly had made up her
mind about Cradock as now a bad speculation, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was not likely that she should love yet any one
who meant to have him.</p>

<p>Amy shrunk back as her nice clean skirt swept
the grimy threshold. She was not by any means
fidgety, but had a nervous dislike of dirt, as most
upright natures have. Then she felt ashamed of
herself, and coloured yet more deeply to think that
a place good enough for Cradock should seem
too sordid for her, indeed! And then her tears
glanced in the gas&ndash;light, that Cradock should ever
have come to this, and partly, no doubt, for her
sake, though she never could tell how.</p>

<p>The little shop was afforested with Christmas&ndash;trees
of all sorts and of every pattern, as large as
ever could be squeezed, with a knuckle of root to
keep them steady, into pots No. 32. The costermongers
repudiate larger pots, because they take
too much room on a truck, and involve the necessity
of hiring a boy to push.</p>

<p>Aucuba, Irish yew, Portugal laurel, arbor vitæ,
and bay&ndash;tree, but most of all&mdash;and for the purpose
by far the most convenient, because of the hat&ndash;peg
order&mdash;the stiff, self&ndash;confident, argumentative
spruce. All these, when they have done their
spiriting, and yielded long&ndash;remembered fun, will
be fondly tended by gentle&ndash;hearted girls on some
suburban balcony; they will be watered enough to
kill lignum vitæ; patent compost will be bought at
about the price of sugar; learned consultations
will be held between Sylvia and Lucilla; and then,
as the leaves grow daily more yellow, and papa is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
so provoking that he will only shake his head (too
sagaciously to commit himself), an earnest appeal
will be addressed to some of the gardening papers.
Or perhaps the tree will be planted, with no little
ceremony, in the centre of some grass&ndash;plot nearly
as large as a counterpane; while the elder members
of the family, though bland enough to drink
its health, regard the measure as very unwise, because
the house will be darkened so in a few short
years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the editorʼs reply arrives&mdash;“Possibly
Sylviaʼs tree has no roots.” He is laughed to scorn
for his ignorance, until little Charley falls to work
with his Ramsgate spade unbidden. <i>Factura nepotibus
umbram!</i> It has been chopped all round the
bole with a hatchet, and is as likely to grow as
a lucifer&ndash;match.</p>

<p>Through that Christmas Tabraca John Rosedew
led his daughter, begging her at every step to be
careful of the trees, whose claims upon her attention
she postponed to those of her frock.</p>

<p>“Lor bless me, sir, is that you now, and your
good lady along of you! How glad I am, to be
sure!”</p>

<p>“Miss Ducksacre, this is my daughter, Miss
Amy Rosedew, of whom you have heard me
speak;” here John executed a flourish of great
complacency with his hat; “my only child, but as
good to me as any dozen could be. Will you allow
her to stop here a minute, while I go up&ndash;stairs?”</p>

<p>Amy was trembling now, more and more every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
moment, and John would not ask how Cradock
was, for fear of frightening his daughter.</p>

<p>“To be sure she can stay here,” said Polly, not
over graciously; for if Mr. Clinkers should come
in the while, it might alter his ideal.</p>

<p>“Ah, so very sad; so very sad, miss, ainʼt it
now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Amy, having no desire to pursue
the subject with Polly. But Pollyʼs tongue could
no more keep still than a frond of maiden&ndash;hair fern
in the draught of a river archway.</p>

<p>“Ah, so very sad! To think of him go, quite
young as he is, to one of them moonstruck
smilems, where they makes rope&ndash;mats and tiger
rugs! As ‘andsome a young man, miss, as ever I
see off a hengine; and of course he must be such,
being as he is your brother.”</p>

<p>Before poor Amy could answer, Mrs. Ducksacre
came to fetch her, and frowned very hard at Polly,
who began to look out of the window. In spite of
all her faith and hope, the child could scarcely get
up the stairs, till her father came to meet her.</p>

<p>“There is no one with him now, dear; Mrs.
Jupp is in the sitting&ndash;room, so very kindly lent us
by the good landlady. Only two more pairs of
stairs, and there our Cradock lies, not a bit worse
than he was; if anything, a little better; and his
faithful little Wena with him: she wonʼt leave
him, night or day, dear. Give me your hand, Amy.
Why, I declare, it is rather dark, when you get too
far from the windows! Madam, come in with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>But Eliza Ducksacre, though little versed in
mintage, and taking pig&ndash;rings for halfpence, knew
when her presence had better be absence, as well
as a sleeping partner does at the associationʼs
bankruptcy. So, after showing them up to the
door, she slipped away into the side&ndash;cupboard
which Mr. Rosedew had called a “sitting&ndash;room.”</p>

<p>Then John took Amyʼs bonnet off (after ruining
the strings), and stroked her pretty hair down, and
took her young cheeks in his hands, and begged
her not to tremble so, because she would quite upset
him. Only she might cry a little, if she thought
it would do her good. But when she put her hand
up, and gave a dry sob only, the father led her
very tenderly into the little chamber.</p>

<p>It was a wretched little room, like a casual
pauperʼs home, when he gets one, only much
lower and smaller. Amy took all of it in at a
glance, for in matters of that sort a womanʼs perception
is, when compared to a manʼs, as forked
lightning compared to a blunt dessert fork.</p>

<p>She even knew why the bed was awry; which
her father could sooner have written ten scolia
than discover. The bed was placed so because
poor Cradock, jumping up all of a sudden in an
early stage of illness, and before his head grew
soft, had knocked a great piece of plaster away
from the projecting hip&ndash;beam.</p>

<p>Now Craddy was looking away from them,
sitting up in the sack&ndash;cloth bed, and trying with
the sage gravity of fixed hallucination to read some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
lines which his fancy had written on the glazed
dirt that served for a window. That window perhaps
pronounced itself more by candlelight than
by daylight, and the landlord had forbidden any
attempt at cleaning it, because he knew that the
frame would drop out. Two candles, the residue
of two pounds which Mr. Rosedew had paid for,
only helped to interpret the squalid room more
forcibly.</p>

<p>While Amy stood there, shocked and frightened,
and her father was thinking what to say, the poor
sick fellow turned towards them, and his eyes met
hers. She saw that the tint of her loverʼs eyes
was gone from a beautiful deep grey to the tone
of a withered oak&ndash;leaf, the pupils forthstanding
haggardly, the whites dull and chased with blood
veins, the sockets marked with a cloudy blue, and
channeled with storms of sorrow; the countenance
full of long suffering&mdash;gaunt, and wan, and weary.</p>

<p>Amy could not weep, but gazed, never thinking
anything, with all the love and pity, devotion and
faith eternal, which are sure to shine in a womanʼs
eyes when trouble strikes its light there. How
different from the shy maidʼs glance which, only a
month or two ago, would have met his youthful
overtures! And how infinitely grander! Something
of the good All&ndash;Fatherʼs power and mercy
in it.</p>

<p>She kept her eyes upon him. She had no power
to move them. And they changed exactly as his
did. The pale glance wandering into her gaze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with an appealing submissive motion, eager to
settle somewhere, but too faint to ask for sympathy,
began to feel its way and fasten, began to
quiver with vibrant light and sense of resting somewhere,
began to quicken, flush, and deepen&mdash;from
what fountain God only knows&mdash;then to waver
and suffuse (in feeble consciousness of grief),
retire and return again, fluttering to some remembered
home, as a bird in the dark comes to his
nest; then to thrill, and beam, and sparkle with
the light, the life, the love.</p>

<p>So with a weak but joyful cry, like a shipwrecked
man at his hearth again, he stretched out
both his wasted arms, and Amy was there without
knowing it. She laid his white cheek on her
shoulder, and let her hair flow over it; she held
him up with her own pure breast, till his worn
heart beat on her warm one. Then she sobbed,
and laughed, and sobbed, and called him her world,
and heart, and heaven, and kissed his nestling
forehead, and looked, and asked, oh, where the
love was. All she begged for was one word, just
one little word, if you please, to know who was to
come to comfort him. Oh, he must know her&mdash;of
course he must&mdash;wouldnʼt she know him, that
was all, though she hadnʼt a breath of life left?
His own, his faith, his truth, his love&mdash;his own&mdash;let
him say who, and she never would cry again.
Only say it once, his own&mdash;</p>

<p>“Amy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Amy, Amy, Amy. Say it again,
oh! say it again, my poor everlasting love!”</p>

<p>Suddenly the barriers of his frozen grief were
loosened. With a feeble arm staying on her,
although it could not cling to her, he burst into a
flood of tears, from the fountain of great waters
whose source and home is God.</p>

<p>Then John, who had stood at the door all the
time, with his white head bowed on his coat&ndash;sleeve,
came forward and took a hand of each, knelt by
the bed, and gave thanks. They wanted not to
talk of it, nor any doctor to tell them. Because
they had an angelʼs voice, that God would be
gracious to them.</p>

<p>“Darlings, didnʼt I tell you,” said Amy, looking
up at them, with her rich curls tear&ndash;bespangled,
like a young grape&ndash;leaf in the vinery; “donʼt
you know that I was sure our Father would never
forsake us; and that even a simple thing like me
might fetch back my own blessing? Oh, you
never would have loved me so; only God knew
it was good for us.”</p>

<p>While she spoke, Cradock looked at her with a
faint far&ndash;off intelligence, not entering into her
arguments. He only cared to hear her voice; to
see her every now and then; and touch her to
make sure of it; then to dream that it was an
angel; then to wake and be very glad that it was
not, but was Amy.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="p2">Slowly from that night, but surely, Cradockʼs
mind began to return, like a child to its mother,
who is stretching forth her arms to it; timid at
first and wondering, and apt for a long time to
reel and stagger at very slight shocks or vibrations.
Then as the water comes over the ice in a gradual
gentle thaw, beginning to gleam at the margin
first, where the reeds are and the willow&ndash;trees,
then gliding slowly and brightly on, following
every skate&ndash;mark or line where a rope or stick has
been, till it flows into a limpid sheet; so crystal
reason dawned and wavered, felt its way and went
on again, tracing many a childish channel, many
a dormant memory, across that dull lethargic
mind, until the bright surface was restored, and
the lead line of judgment could penetrate.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedew quartered himself and his Amy at
the Portland Hotel hard by, and reckless of all
expense moved Cradock into Mrs. Ducksacreʼs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
very best room. He would have done this long
ago, only the doctor would not allow it. Then
Amy, who did not like London at all, because
there were so few trees in it, hired some of the
Christmas&ndash;grove from the fair greengrocers, and
decked out the little sitting&ndash;room, so that Cradock
had sweet visions of the Queenʼs bower mead. As
for herself, she would stay in the shop, perhaps
half an hour together, and rejoice in the ways of
the children. All her pocket&ndash;money went into the
till as if you had taken a shovel to it. Barcelonas,
Brazils, and cob&ndash;nuts she was giving all day to the
“warmints;” and golden oranges rolled before her
as from Atalantaʼs footstep.</p>

<p>It is a most wonderful fact, and far beyond my
philosophy, that instead of losing her roses in
London, as a country girl ought to have done,
Amy bloomed with more Jacqueminot upon very
bright occasions&mdash;more Louise Odier constantly,
with Goubalt in the dimples, then toning off at any
new fright to Malmaison, or Devoniensis&mdash;more of
these roses now carmined or mantled in the delicate
turn of her cheeks than ever had nestled and
played there in the free air of the Forest. Good
Aunt Doxy was quite amazed on the Saturday
afternoon, when meeting her brother and niece at
the station&mdash;for it made no difference in the outlay,
and the drive would do her good&mdash;she found,
not a pale and withered child, worn out with
London racket, and freckled with dust and smokespots,
but the loveliest Amy she had ever yet seen&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was something indeed to say,&mdash;with a
brilliance of bloom which the good aunt at once
proceeded to test with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>But before the young lady left town&mdash;to wit, on
the Friday evening&mdash;she had a little talk with
Rachel Jupp, or rather with strapping Issachar,
which nearly concerns our story.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Amy,” said Rachel that morning&mdash;”Miss
Amy” sounded more natural somehow than
“Miss Rosedew” did&mdash;”so youʼre going away,
miss, after all, and never see my Looey; and a
pretty child she is, and a good one, and a quiet
one, and father never lift hand to her now; and
the poor young gentleman saved her life, and he
like her so much, and she like him.”</p>

<p>“I will come and see her this evening, as you
have so kindly asked me. That is, with my papaʼs
leave, and if you donʼt mind coming for me to the
inn at six oʼclock. I am afraid of walking by
myself after dark in London. My papa has found
some books at the bookstalls, and he is so delighted
with them he never wants me after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Amy, would you mind, then&mdash;would
you mind taking a drop of tea with us?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will. I mean, if it is quite convenient,
and if you can be spared here, and if&mdash;oh
nothing else, Mrs. Jupp, only I shall be most
happy.” She was going to say, “and if you wonʼt
make any great preparations,” but she knew how
sensitive poor people are at restraints upon hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>So grand preparations were made; and grander
still they would have been, and more formal and
uncomfortable, if Amy had finished her sentence.
Rachel at once rushed off to her lord, whose
barge&ndash;shaped frame was moored alongside of his
wharf, dreaming as stolidly as none except a
bargee can dream. He immediately shelled out
seven and sixpence from the cuddy of his inexpressibles,
and left his wife to her own devices,
except in the matter of tea itself. The tea he was
resolved to fetch from a little shop in the barge&ndash;walk,
where, as Mother Hamp declared, who kept
the tobacco&ndash;shop by the gate, they sold tea as
strong as brandy.</p>

<p>“If you please to excuse our Zakey, miss,
taking no more tea,” said Mrs. Jupp, after
Issachar had laboured very hard at it, the host
being bound, in his opinion, to feast even as the
guest did; “because he belong to the antiteatotallers,
as takes nothing no stronger than
gin, miss.”</p>

<p>“Darrnʼt take more nor one noggin of tay,
miss,” cried Mr. Jupp, touching his short front
curl with a hand scrubbed in quick&ndash;lime and copperas;
“likes it, but it donʼt like me, miss. Makes
me feel quite intemperant like,&mdash;so narvous, and
queer, and staggery. Looey, dear, dadʼs mild
mixture, for to speak the young ladyʼs health in.
Leastways, by your lave, miss.”</p>

<p>Dadʼs mild mixture soon made its appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in a battered half&ndash;gallon can, and Mr. Jupp was
amazed and grieved that none but himself would
quaff any. The strongest and headiest stuff it
was, which even the publicans of London, alchymists
of villainy, can quassify, and cocculise, and
nux&ndash;vomicise up to proof. Then, the wrath of
hunger and thirst being mollified, Issachar begged
leave to smoke, if altogether agreeable, and it
would all go up the chimney; which, however, it
refrained from doing.</p>

<p>Now, while he is smoking, I may admit that the
contents of Mr. Juppʼs census&ndash;paper (if, indeed, he
ever made legal entries, after punching the collectorʼs
head) have not been transcribed to the
satisfaction of the Registrar&ndash;General or Home&ndash;Office,
or whoever or whatever he or it is, who or
which insists upon knowing nine times as much
about us as we know about ourselves. Mr. Jupp
was a bargee of Catholic views; “it warnʼt no odds
to he” whether he worked upon wharf or water, sea
or river or canal, at coal, or hay, or lime, breeze, or
hop&ndash;poles, or anything else. Now and then he
went down to Gravesend, or up the river to Kingston
or Staines; but his more legitimate area was
navigable by three canals, where a chap might find
time to eat his dinner, and give his wife and nag
theirʼn. Issacharʼs love of nature always culminated
at one oʼclock; and then how he loved to halt
his team under a row of alders, and see the painted
meadows gay, and have grub and pipe accordinʼ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
His three canals, affording these choice delights
unequally, were the Surrey, the Regentʼs, and the
Basingstoke.</p>

<p>That last was, indeed, to his rural mind, the
nearest approach to Paradise; but as there is in all
things a system of weights and measures, Mr. Jupp
got better wages upon the other two, and so could
not very often afford to indulge his love of the
beautiful. Hence he kept his household gods
within reach of the yellow Tibers, and took them
only once a year for a treat upon the Anio. Then
would Rachel Jupp and Looey spend a summer
month afloat, enjoying the rural glimpses and the
sliding quietude of inland navigation, and keeping
the pot a&ndash;boiling in the state&ndash;cabin of the <i>Enterprise</i>
or the <i>Industrious Maiden</i>.</p>

<p>Now Amy having formed Looʼs acquaintance,
and said what was right and pretty in gratitude for
their entertainment and faithful kindness to Cradock,
was just about to leave them, when Issachar
Jupp delivered this speech, very slowly, as a man
who has got to the marrow and popeʼs&ndash;eye of his
pipe:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now ‘scuse me for axing of you, miss, and if
any ways wrong in so doing, be onscrupulous for
to say so, and no harm done or taken. But I has
my raisons for axing, from things as Iʼve a ‘earʼd
him say, and oncommon good raisons too. If you
please, what be the arkerate name and dwellinʼ&ndash;place
of the young gent as saved our Loo? Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Clinkers couldnʼt find out, miss, though he knowed
as it warnʼt ‘Charles Newman.’”</p>

<p>“Donʼt you know his story, then?” asked Amy,
in some astonishment. “I thought you knew all
about it, and were so kind to him partly through
that, though you were kind enough not to talk to
me about it.”</p>

<p>“We guesses a piece here and there, miss, since
he talk so wild in his illness. And thatʼs what
made me be axing of you; for I knowed one name
right well as he out with once or twice; not at all a
common name nother. But we knows for sartin no
more nor this, that he be an onlucky young gent,
and the best as ever come into these parts.”</p>

<p>“There can be no harm in my telling you, such
faithful friends as you are. And the sad tale is
known to every one, far and wide, in our part of
Hampshire.”</p>

<p>“Hampshire, ah!” said Mr. Jupp, with a very
mysterious look; “we knowed Mr. Rosedew come
from Hampshire, and that set us the more a&ndash;thinkinʼ
of it. Loo, child, run for dadʼs bacco&ndash;box, as were
left to Mother Richardsonʼs, and if it ainʼt there,
try at Blinkin’ Davyʼs, and if he ainʼt got it, try
Mother Hamp.”</p>

<p>The child, sadly disappointed, for her eyes were
large with hopes of a secret about her “dear gentleman,”
as she called Cradock, departed upon her long
errand. Then Amy told, as briefly as possible, all
she knew of the great mishap, and the misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
which followed it. From time to time her soft
voice shook, and her tears would not be disciplined;
while Rachel Juppʼs strayed anyhow. But Issachar
listened dryly and sternly, with one great brown
hand on his forehead. Not once did he interrupt
the young lady, by gesture, look, or question.
But when she had finished, he said very quietly,</p>

<p>“One name, miss, as have summat to do with it,
Iʼve not ‘earʼd you sinnify; and it were the sound
o’ that very name as fust raised my coorosity.
‘Scuse me, miss, but I wouldnʼt ax, only for good
raison.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what right I have to mention
any other names,” replied Amy, blushing and
hesitating, for she did not wish to speak of Pearl
Garnet; “there is only one other name connected
at all with the matter, and that one of no importance.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” returned Jupp, with a glance as intense
as a catʼs through a dairy keyhole, “maybe the tow&ndash;rope
ainʼt nothin’ to do with the goin’ of the barge,
miss. That name didnʼt happen permiskious now
to be the name of Garnet, maʼam?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed it did. But how could you know
that, Mr. Jupp?”</p>

<p>“Pearl Garnet were the name I ‘earʼd on, and
that ainʼt a very common name, leastways to my
experience. Now, could it ‘ave ‘appened by a
haxident that her good fatherʼs name were Bull
Garnet?”</p>

<p>Amy drew back, for Mr. Jupp, in his triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and excitement, had laid down his pipe, and was
stretching out his unpeeled crate of a hand, as if to
take her by the shoulder, and shake the whole truth
out of her. It was his fashion with Rachel, and he
quite forgot the difference. Mrs. Jupp cried,
“Zakey, Zakey!” in a tone of strong remonstrance.
But he was not abashed very seriously.</p>

<p>“It couldnʼt be now, could it, miss; it wornʼt in
any way possible that Pearl Garnetʼs father was
ever known by the name of Bull Garnet?”</p>

<p>“But indeed that is his name, Mr. Jupp. Why
should you be so incredulous?”</p>

<p>“Oncredulous it be, miss; oncredulous, as I be
a sinner. Rachey, whoʼd ha’ thought it? How
things does come about, to be sure! Now please
to tell me, miss&mdash;very careful, and not passinʼ
lightly of anything; never you mind how small it
seem&mdash;every word you knows about Pearl Garnet
and that there&mdash;job there; and all you knows on
her father too.”</p>

<p>“You must prove to me first, Mr. Jupp, that I
have any right to do so.”</p>

<p>Issachar now was strongly excited, a condition
most unusual with him, except when his wife
rebelled, and that she had, years ago, ceased to do.
He put his long black face, which was working so
that the high cheek&ndash;bones almost shut the little
eyes, quite close to Amyʼs little white ear, and
whispered,</p>

<p>“If ye dunna tell me, yeʼll cry for it arl the life
long, yeʼll never right the innocent, and yeʼll let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
guilty ride over ye. I canna tell no more just now,
but every word is gospel. I be no liar, miss,
though I be rough enough, God knows. Supposes
He made me so.”</p>

<p>Then Amy, trembling at his words, and thinking
that she had hurt his feelings, put her soft little
hand, for amends, into Zakeyʼs great black piece of
hold, which looked like the bilge of a barge; and
he wondered what to do with it, such a sort of chap
as he was. He had never heard of kissing a hand,
and even if he had it would scarcely be a timely
offering, for he was having a chaw to compose
himself&mdash;yet he knew that he ought not, in good
manners, to let go her hand in a hurry; so what
did he do but slip off a ring (one of those so&ndash;called
galvanic rings, in which sailors and bargemen have
wonderful faith as an antidote to rheumatics, tick
dolorous, and the Caroline Morgan), and this ring
he passed down two of her fingers, for all females
do love trinkets so. Amy kept it carefully, and
will put it on her chatelaine, if ever she institutes
one.</p>

<p>Then, being convinced by his words and manner,
she told him everything she knew about the Garnet
family&mdash;their behaviour in and after the great
misfortune; the strange seclusion of Pearl, and
Mr. Garnetʼs illness. And then she recurred to
some vague rumours which had preceded their
settlement in the New Forest. To all this
Issachar listened, without a word or a nod, but
with his narrow forehead radiant with concentration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
his lips screwed up in a serrate ring, after the
manner of a medlar, and a series of winks so
intensely sage that his barge might have turned a
corner with a team of eight blind horses, and no
nod wanted for one of them.</p>

<p>“Ainʼt there no more nor that, miss?” he asked,
with some disappointment, when the little tale was
ended; “canʼt you racollack no more?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed I cannot. And if you had not
some important object, I should be quite ashamed
of telling you so much gossip. If I may ask you
a question now, what more did you expect me to
tell you?”</p>

<p>“That they had knowʼd, miss, as Bull Garnet
were Sir Cradock Nowellʼs brother.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Garnet Sir Cradockʼs brother! You must
be mistaken, Mr. Jupp. My father has known
Sir Cradock Nowell ever since he was ten years
old; and he could not have failed to know it, if it
had been so.”</p>

<p>“Most like he do know it, miss. But dunna
you tell him now, nor any other charp. It be true
as gospel for all that, though.”</p>

<p>“Then Robert and Pearl are Cradockʼs first
cousins, and Mr. Garnet is his uncle!”</p>

<p>“Not ezackly as you counts things,” answered
the bargeman, looking at the fire; “but in the way
as we does.”</p>

<p>Amy felt that she must ask no more, at least
upon that subject; and that she was not likely to
speak of it even to her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let him go, miss,” continued Issachar, referring
now to Cradock; “let him go for a long sea&ndash;vohoyage,
same as doctor horders un. He be better out of
the way for a spell or two. The Basingstoke ainʼt
fur enoo, whur I meant to ‘ave took him. ‘A mun
be quite out o’ the kintry till this job be over like.
And niver a word as to what I thinks to coom
anigh his ear, miss, if so be you vallies his
raison.”</p>

<p>“But you forget, Mr. Jupp, that you have not
told me, as yet, at all what it is you do think. You
said some things which frightened me, and you told
me one which astonished me. Beyond that I know
nothing.”</p>

<p>“And better so, my dear young leddy, a vast
deal better so. Only you have the very best hopes,
and keep your spirits roaring. Zakey Jupp never
take a thing in hand but what he go well through
with it. Ask Rachey about that. Now this were
a casooal haxident, mind you, only a casooal
haxident&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course we all know that, Mr. Jupp. No
one would dare to think anything else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; all right, miss. And weʼll find out
who did the casooal haxident&mdash;thatʼs all, miss, thatʼs
all. Only you hold your tongue.”</p>

<p>She was obliged to be content with this, and on
the whole it greatly encouraged her. Then she
returned to the Portland Hotel under convoy of
all the Jupp family, and Issachar got into two or
three rows by hustling every one out of her way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Although poor Amy was frightened at this, no
doubt it increased her faith in him through some
feminine process of dialectics unknown to the
author of the Organon.</p>

<p>Though Amy could not bear to keep anything
secret from her father, having given her word
she of course observed it, and John was greatly
surprised at the spirits in which his daughter took
leave of Cradock. But there were many points in
Amyʼs character, as has been observed before,
which her father never understood; and he concluded
that this was a specimen of them, and was
delighted to see her so cheerful.</p>

<p>Now, being returned to Nowelhurst, he held
counsel with sister Eudoxia, who thoroughly deserved
to have a vote after contributing so to the
revenue. And the result of their Lateran&mdash;for
they both were bricks&mdash;council was as follows:
That John was bound, howsoever much it went
against his proud stomach after his previous treatment,
to make one last appeal from the father according
to the spirit to the father according to the
flesh, in favour of the unlucky son who was now
condemned to exile, so as at least to send him away
in a manner suitable to his birth. That, if this
appeal were rejected, and the appellant treated
unpleasantly&mdash;which was almost sure to follow&mdash;he
could not, consistently with his honour and his
clerical dignity, hold any longer the benefices
(paltry as they were), the gifts of a giver now
proved unkind. That thereupon Mr. Rosedew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
should first provide for Cradockʼs voyage so far as
his humble means and small influence permitted;
and after that should settle at Oxford, where he
might get parochial duty, and where his old tutorial
fame and repute (now growing European
from a life of learning) would earn him plenty of
pupils&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“And a professorship at least!” Miss Eudoxia
broke in; for, much as she nagged at her brother,
she was proud as could be of his knowledge.</p>

<p>“Marry, ay, and a bishopric,” John answered,
smiling pleasantly; “you have often menaced me,
Doxy dear, with Jemimaʼs apron.”</p>

<p>So, on a bright day in January, John Rosedew
said to Jem Pottles, “Saddle me the horse, James.”
And they saddled him the “horse”&mdash;not so called
by his master through any false aggrandisement
(such as maketh us talk of “the servants,” when
we have only got a maid&ndash;of&ndash;all&ndash;work), but because
the parson, in pure faith, regarded him as a horse
of full equine stature and super&ndash;equine powers.</p>

<p>After tightening up the girths, then&mdash;for that
noble cob, at the saddling period, blew himself out
with a large sense of humour (unappreciated by
the biped who bestraddled him unwarily), an abdominal
sense of humour which, as one touch of nature
makes the whole world kin, induced the pigskin to
circulate after the manner of a brass dogʼs collar&mdash;tush,
I mean a dogʼs brass collar&mdash;in order to learn
what the joke was down in those festive regions;
therefore, having buckled him up six inches, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the witty nag creaked like a tight&ndash;laced maid, away
rode the parson towards the Hall. Much liefer
would he have walked by the well&ndash;known and pleasant
footpath, but he felt himself bound, as one may
say, to go in real style, sir.</p>

<p>The more he reflected upon the nature of his
errand, the fainter grew his hopes of success; he
even feared that his ancient friendship would not
procure him a hearing, so absorbed were all the
echoes of memory in the pique of parental jealousy,
and the cajoleries of a woman. And the consequences
of failure&mdash;how bitter they must be to him
and his little household! Moreover, he dearly
loved his two little quiet parishes; and, though he
reaped more tithe from them in kindness than in
kind or by commutation, to his contented mind
they were far sweeter than the incumbency of
Libya&ndash;cum&ndash;Gades, and both P&oelig;ni for his beadles.</p>

<p>He thought of Amy with a bitter pang, and of
his sister with heaviness, as he laid his hand&mdash;for
he never used whip&mdash;on the fat flank of the pony
to urge him almost to a good round trot, that suspense
might sooner be done with. And when the
Hall was at last before him, he rode up, not to the
little postern hard by the housekeeperʼs snuggery
(which had seemed of old to be made for him), but
to the grand front entrance, where the orange&ndash;trees
in tubs were, and the myrtles, and the
pilasters.</p>

<p>Most of the trees had been removed, with the
aid of little go&ndash;carts, before the frosts began; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
they impressed John Rosedew none the less, so far
as his placid and simple mind was open to small
impressions.</p>

<p>Dismounting from Coræbus, whose rusty snaffle
and mildewed reins would have been a disgrace
to any horse, as Amy said every day, he rang the
main entrance bell, and wondered whether they
would let him in.</p>

<p>That journey had cost him a very severe battle,
to bear himself humbly before the wrong, and to
do it in the cause of the injured. In the true and
noble sense of pride, there could not be a prouder
man than the gentle parson. But he ruled that
noble human pride with its grander element, left
in it by the Son of God, His incarnationʼs legacy,
the pride which never apes, but is itself humility.</p>

<p>At last the door was opened, not by the spruce
young footman (who used to look so much at Amy,
and speer about as to her expectations, because she
was only a parsonʼs daughter), but by that ancient
and most respectable Job Hogstaff, patriarch of
butlers. Dull and dim as his eyes were growing,
Job, who now spent most of his time in looking for
those who never came, had made out Mr. Rosedewʼs
approach, by virtue of the ponyʼs most unmistakable
shamble. Therefore he pulled down
his best coat from a jug&ndash;crook, twitched his white
hair to due stiffness, pushed the ostiary footman
back with a scorn which rankled for many a day
under a zebra waistcoat, and hobbled off at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
utmost pace to admit the visitor now so strange,
though once it was strange without him.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedew walked in very slowly and stiffly,
then turned aside to a tufted mat, and began to
wipe his shoes in the most elaborate manner,
though there was not a particle of dirt upon them.
Old Jobʼs eyes blinked vaguely at him: he felt
there was something wrong in that.</p>

<p>“Donʼt ye do that, sir, now; for Godʼs sake
donʼt do that. I canʼt abear it; and thatʼs the
truth.”</p>

<p>Full well the old man remembered how different,
in the happy days, had been John Rosedewʼs
entrance; and now every scrub on the mat
was a rub on his shaky hard&ndash;worn heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedew looked mildly surprised, for his
apprehension (as we know) was swifter on paper
than pavement. But he held forth his firm strong
hand, and the old man bowed tearfully over it.</p>

<p>“Any news of our boy, sir? Any news of my
boy as was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Job; very bad news. He has been
terribly ill in London, and nobody there to care
for him.”</p>

<p>“Then Iʼll throw up my situation, sir. Manyʼs
the time I have threatened them, but didnʼt like to
be too hard like. And pretty goings on thereʼd
be, without old Job in the pantry. But I bainʼt
bound to stand everything for the saving of them
as goes on so. And that Hismallitish woman, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
find fault with my buckles, and nice things she
herself wear&mdash;Iʼd a given notice a week next
Monday, but that I likes Miss Oa so, and feel
myself bound, as you may say, to see out this Sir
Cradock; folk would say I were shabby to leave
him now he be gettin’ elderly. Man and boy for
sixty year, and began no more than boot&ndash;cleaning;
man and boy for sixty&ndash;three year, come next
Lammas&ndash;tide. I should like it upon my tombstone,
sir, with what God pleases added, if I not
make too bold, and you the master of the churchyard,
if so be you should live long enough, when
my turn come, God willing.”</p>

<p>“It will not be in my power, Job. But if ever
it is, you may trust me.”</p>

<p>“And I wants that in I was tellin’ my niece
about, ‘Put Thy hand in the hollow of my thigh.’
Holy Bible, you know, sir, and none canʼt object
to that.”</p>

<p>“Come, Job, my good friend, you must not
talk so sepulchrally. Leave His own good time to
God.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, sir; I bainʼt in no hurry yet.
Iʼve a sight of things to see to, and my master
must go first, he be so very particular. Iʼll live to
see the young master yet, as my duty is for to do.
<i>He</i> ‘ont carry on with a Hismallitish woman; <i>he</i>
‘ont say, ‘What, Hogstaff, are your wits gone
wool&ndash;gatherinʼ?’ and his own wits all the time, sir,
fleeced, fleeced, fleeced&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here John Rosedew cut short the contrast between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the present and the future master (which
would soon have assumed a golden tinge as of the
Fourth Eclogue), for the parson was too much a
gentleman to foster millennial views at the expense
of the head of the household.</p>

<p>“Job, take my card to your master; and tell
him, with my compliments, that I wish to see him
alone, if he will so far oblige me. By&ndash;the&ndash;by, I
ought to have written first, to request an interview;
but it never occurred to me.”</p>

<p>He could scarcely help sighing as he thought
of formality re&ndash;established on the ruins of familiarity.</p>

<p>“Heʼll be in the little coved room, no doubt,
long o’ that Hismallitish woman. But step in here
a moment, sir.”</p>

<p>Instead of passing the doorway, which the butler
had thrown open for him, Mr. Rosedew stood scrupulously
on the mat, as if it marked his territory,
until the old man came back and showed him into
the black oak parlour.</p>

<p>The little coved room was calmly and sweetly
equal to the emergency. The moment Jobʼs heels
were out of sight, Mrs. Corklemore, who had been
indulging in a nice little chat with Sir Cradock,
“when she ought to have been at work all the
while, plain&ndash;sewing for her little household, for
who was to keep the wolf from the door, if she
shrank from a womanʼs mission&mdash;though irksome
to her, she must confess, for it did hurt her poor
fingers so”&mdash;here she held up a dish&ndash;cloth rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rougher than a coal&ndash;sack, which she had stolen
cleverly from her hostʼs own lower regions, and
did not know from a glass&ndash;cloth; but it suited her
because it was brown, and set off her lily hands
so;&mdash;”oh, Uncle Cradock, in all this there is something
sweetly sacred, because it speaks of <i>home</i>!”
She was darning it all the while with white silk,
and took good care to push it away when any servant
came in. It had lasted her now for a week,
and had earned her a hundred guineas, having
made the most profound impression upon its legitimate
owner. She would earn another hundred
before the week was out by knitting a pair of
rough worsted socks for her little Flore, “though
it made her heart bleed to think how that poor
child hated the feel of them.”</p>

<p>Now she rose in haste from her chair, and
pushed the fortunate dish&ndash;cloth, with a very expressive
air, into her pretty work&ndash;basket, and drew
the strings loudly over it.</p>

<p>“What are you going for, Georgie? You need
not leave the room, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, uncle dear, I must. You are so clear
and so honest, I know; and most likely I take it
from you. But I could not have anything to do
with any secret dealings, uncle, even though you
wished it, which I am sure you never could. I
never could keep a secret, uncle, because I am so
shallow. Whenever secrecy is requested, I feel as
if there was something dishonest, either done or
contemplated. Very foolish of me, I know, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
my nature is so childishly open. And of course
Mr. Rosedew has a perfect right, and is indeed
very wise, to conceal his scheme with respect to his
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Georgie, stay in this room, if you please; he
is not coming here.”</p>

<p>“But that poor simple Amy will, if he has
brought her with him. Well, I will stay here and
lecture her, uncle, about her behaviour to you.”</p>

<p>After all this the old man set forth, in some little
irritation, to receive his once&ndash;loved friend. He
entered the black oak parlour in a cold and stately
manner, and bowed without a word to John, who
had crossed the room to meet him. The parson
held out his hand, as a lover and preacher of peace
should do; but the offer, ay, and the honour too,
not being at all appreciated, he withdrew it with a
crimson blush all over his bright clear cheeks, as
deep as his daughterʼs would have been.</p>

<p>Then Sir Cradock Nowell, trying to seem quite
calm and collected, addressed his visitor thus:</p>

<p>“Sir, I am indebted to you for the honour of
this visit. I apologize for receiving you in a room
without a fire. Pray take a chair. I have no
doubt that your intentions are kind towards me.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” replied the parson, speaking
much faster than usual, and with the frill of his
shirt&ndash;front rising; “I thank you, Sir Cradock
Nowell; but I will not sit down in the house of a
gentleman who declines to take my hand. I am
here much against my own wishes, and only because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I supposed that it was my duty to come. I
am here on behalf of your son, a noble but most
unfortunate youth, and now in great trouble of
mind.”</p>

<p>If he had only said “in great bodily danger,” it
might have made a difference.</p>

<p>“Your interest in him is very kind; and I trust
that he will be grateful, which he never was to me.
He has left his home in defiance of me. I can do
nothing for him until he comes back, and is penitent.
But surely the question concerns me rather
than you, Mr. Rosedew.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to find,” answered John, quite
calmly, “that you think me guilty of impertinent
meddling. But even that I would bear, as becomes
my age and my profession,”&mdash;here he gave
Sir Cradock a glance, which was thoroughly understood,
because they had been at school together,&mdash;”and
more than that I would do, Cradock
Nowell, for a man I have loved like you, sir.”</p>

<p>That “sir” came out very oddly. John poked
it in, as a retractation for having called him “Cradock
Nowell,” and as a salve to his own self&ndash;respect,
lest he should have been too appealing.
And to follow up this view of the subject, he
made a bow such as no man makes to one from
whom he begs anything. But Sir Cradock
Nowell lost altogether the excellence of the bow.
The parson had put up his knee in a way which
took the old man back to Sherborne. His mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was there playing cob&ndash;nut as fifty years since,
with John Rosedew. Once more he saw the
ruddy, and then pugnacious, John bringing his
calf up, and priming his knee, for the cob&ndash;nut to
lie upon it. This he always used to do, and not
care a flip for the whack upon it, instead of using
his blue cloth cap, as all the rest of the boys did;
because his father and mother were poor, and
could only afford him one cap in a year.</p>

<p>And so the grand bow was wasted, as most
formalities are: but if John had only known
when to stop, it might have been all right after
all, in spite of Georgie Corklemore. But urged
by the last infirmity (except gout) of noble minds,
our parsons never do know the proper time to
stop. Excellent men, and admirable, they make
us shrink from eternity, by proving themselves
the type of it. Mr. Rosedew spoke well and
eloquently, as he was sure to do; but it would
have been better for his cause if he had simply
described the sonʼs distress, and left the rest to
the fatherʼs heart. At one time, indeed, poor old
Sir Cradock, who was obstinate and misguided,
rather than cold and unloving, began to relent,
and a fatherly yearning fluttered in his grey&ndash;lashed
eyes.</p>

<p>But at this critical moment, three little kicks
at the door were heard, and the handle rattled
briskly; then a shrill little voice came through
the keyhole:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh pease let Fore tum in. Pease do, pease
do, pease do. Me ‘ost me ummy top. Oh you
naughty bad door!”</p>

<p>Then another kick was administered by small
but passionate toe&ndash;toes. Of course your mother
did not send you, innocent bright&ndash;haired popples,
and with a lie so pat and glib in that pouting
pearl&ndash;set mouth. Foolish mother, if she did,
though it seal Attalic bargain!</p>

<p>Sir Cradock went to the door, and gently
ordered the child away. But the interruption
had been enough&mdash;<i>ibi omnis effusus labor</i>. When
he returned and faced John Rosedew the manner
of his visage was altered. The child had reminded
him of her mother, and that graceful, gushing,
loving nature, which tried so hard not to doubt
the minister. So he did what a man in the wrong
generally does instinctively; he swept back the
tide of war into his adversaryʼs country.</p>

<p>“You take a very strong interest, sir, in one
whose nearest relations have been compelled to
abandon him.”</p>

<p>“I thought that your greatest grievance with
him was that he had abandoned you.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me; I cannot split hairs. All I mean
is that something has come to my knowledge&mdash;not
through the proper channel, not from those
who ought to have told me&mdash;something which
makes your advocacy seem a little less disinterested
than I might have supposed it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Have the kindness to tell me what it is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps a mere nothing. But it seems
a significant rumour.”</p>

<p>“What rumour, if you please?”</p>

<p>“That my&mdash;that Cradock Nowell is attached
to your daughter, who behaved so ill to me. Of
course, it is not true?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly true, every word of it.” And John
Rosedew looked at Sir Cradock Nowell as proudly
as ever a father looked. Amy, in his opinion, was
peeress for any mortal. And perhaps he was not
presumptuous.</p>

<p>“Ah!” was the only reply he received: an
“ah” drawn out into half an ell.</p>

<p>“Why, I would have told you long ago, the
moment that I knew it, but for your great trouble,
and your bitterness towards him. You have often
wished that a son of yours should marry my
daughter Amy. Surely you will not blame him
for desiring to do as you wished?”</p>

<p>“No, because he is young and foolish; but I
may blame you for encouraging it, now that he is
the only one.”</p>

<p>“Do you dare to think that I am in any way
influenced by interested motives?”</p>

<p>“I dare to think what I please. No bullying
here, John, if you please. We all know how
combative you are. And, now you have forced
me to it, I will tell you what will be the conviction,
ay, and the expression of every one in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
county, except those who are afraid of you. ‘Mr.
Rosedew has entrapped the future Sir Cradock
Nowell, hushed up the crime, and made all snug
for his daughter at Nowelhurst Hall.’”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock did not mean half his words, any
more than the rest of us do, when hurt; and he
was bitterly sorry for them the moment they were
uttered. They put an impassable barrier between
him and John Rosedew, between him and his
own conscience, for many a day and night to
come.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a pure good man, a man of
large intellect and heart, a lover of truth and
justice more than of himself, confront, without
warning, some black charge, some despicable
calumny, in a word (for I love strong English,
and nothing else will tell it), some damned lie?
If not, I hope you never may, for it makes a manʼs
heart burn so.</p>

<p>John Rosedew was not of the violent order.
Indeed, as his sister Eudoxia said, and to her own
great comfort knew, his cistern of wrathfulness
was so small, and the supply&ndash;pipe so unready&mdash;as
must be where the lower passions filter through
the intellect&mdash;that most people thought it impossible
“to put the parson out.” And very few of
those who knew him could have borne to make
the trial.</p>

<p>Even now, hurt as he was to the very depth of
his heart, he was indignant more than angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would have been more manly of you, Sir
Cradock Nowell, to have said this very mean thing
yourself, than to have put it into the mouths of
others. I grieve for you, and for myself, that so
mean a man was ever my friend. Perhaps you
have still some relics of gentlemanly feeling which
will lead you to perform a hostʼs duty towards his
visitor. Have the kindness to order my horse.”</p>

<p>Then John Rosedew, so punctilious, so polite to
the poorest cottager, turned his broad back upon
the baronet, and as he slowly walked to the door,
these words came over his shoulder:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To&ndash;day you will receive my resignation of
your two benefices. If I live a few years more, I
will repay you all they have brought me above a
curateʼs stipend. My daughter is no fortune&ndash;hunter.
She never shall see your son again,
unless he renounce you and yours for ever, or
you come and implore us humbly as now you have
spoken arrogantly, contemptibly, and meanly.”</p>

<p>Then, fearing lest he had been too grand about
a little matter&mdash;not his daughterʼs marriage, but
the aspersion upon himself&mdash;he closed the door
very carefully, so as not to make any noise,
and walked away towards his home, forgetting
Coræbus utterly. And, before his fine solid face
began to recover its healthy and bashful pink, he
was visited by sore misgivings as to his own behaviour;
to wit, what claim had any man, however
elate with the pride of right and the scorn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wrong, to talk about any fellow&ndash;man becoming
humble to him? Nevertheless, he could not manage
to retract the wrong expression in his letter of resignation;
not from any false pride&mdash;oh no!&mdash;but
for fear of being misunderstood. But that
very night he craved pardon of Him before whom
alone we need humbly bow; who alone can grant
us anything.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="p2">What is lovelier, just when Autumn throws her
lace around us, and begs us not to begin to think
of any spiteful winter, because she has not yet
unfolded half the wealth of her bosom, and will not
look over her shoulder&mdash;when we take that rich one
gaily for her gifts of beauty; what among her
clustered hair, freshened with the hoar&ndash;frost in imitation
of the Spring (all fashions do recur so), tell
us what can be more pretty, pearly, light, and
elegant, more memoried of maidenhood, than a
jolly spiderʼs web?</p>

<p>See how the diamonds quiver and sparkle in the
September morning; what jeweller could have set
them so? All of graduated light and metrical proportion,
every third pre&ndash;eminent, strung on soft
aerial tension, as of woven hoar&ndash;frost, and every
carrying thread encrusted with the breath of fairies,
then crossed and latticed at just angles, with narrowing
interstices, to a radiated octagon&mdash;the more we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
look, the more we wonder at the perfect tracery.
Then, if we gently breathe upon it, or a leaf of the
bramble shivers, how from the open centre a whiff
of waving motion flows down every vibrant radius,
every weft accepts the waft slowly and lulling
vibration, every stay&ndash;rope jerks and quivers, and
all the fleeting subtilty expands, contracts, and
undulates.</p>

<p>Yet if an elegant spider glide out, exquisite,
many&ndash;dappled, pellucid like a Scotch pebble or a
calceolaria, with a dozen dimples upon his back,
and eight fierce eyes all up for business, the moment
he slips from the blackberry&ndash;leaf all sense of
beauty is lost to the gazer, because he thinks of
rapacity.</p>

<p>And so, I fear, John Rosedewʼs hat described in
the air a flourish of more courtesy than cordiality,
when he saw Mrs. Corklemore gliding forth from
the bend of the road in front of him. Although
she had left the house after him, by the help of a
short cut through the gardens, where the rector
would no longer take the liberty of trespassing, she
contrived to meet him as if herself returning from
the village.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Rosedew, I am so glad to see you,”
cried Georgie, as he tried to escape with his bow:
“what a fortunate accident!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said John, not meaning to be rude,
but unwittingly suggesting a modified view of the
bliss.</p>

<p>“Ah, I am so sorry; but you are prejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
against me, I fear, because my simple convictions
incline me to the Low Church view.”</p>

<p>That hit was a very clever one. No other bolt
she could have shot would have brought the parson
to bay so, upon his homeward road, with the important
news he bore.</p>

<p>“I assure you, Mrs. Corklemore, I beg to assure
you most distinctly, that you are quite wrong in
thinking that. Most truly I hope that I have
allowed no prejudice, upon such grounds, to dwell
for a moment with me.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not a ritualist? And you think,
so far as I understand you, that the Low Church
people are quite as good as the High Church?”</p>

<p>“I hope they are as good; still I doubt their
being as right. But charity is greater even than
faith and hope. And, for the sake of charity, I
would wash all rubrics white. If the living are
rebuked for lagging to bury their dead, how shall
they be praised for battling over the Burial
Service?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore, quick as she was, did not
understand the allusion. Mr. Rosedew referred to
a paltry dissension over a corpse in Oxfordshire,
which had created strong disgust, far and near,
among believers; while infidels gloried in it. It
cannot be too soon forgotten and forgiven.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Rosedew, I am so glad that your sentiments
are so liberal. I had always feared that
liberal sentiments proceeded from, or at least were
associated with, weak faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, madam. The most liberal One I
have ever read of was God as well as man. But I
cannot speak of such matters casually, as I would
talk of the weather. If your mind is uneasy, and
I can in any way help you, it is my duty to do so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you. No; I donʼt think I could do
that. We are such Protestants at Coo Nest.
Forgive me, I see I have hurt you.”</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me purposely,” said John
Rosedew, with that crack of perception which
comes (like a chapped lip) suddenly to folks who
are too charitable, “or else you take a strangely
intensified view of the simplest matters. All I
intended was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, oh yes, I am always misunderstanding
everybody. I am so dreadfully stupid and simple.
But you <i>will</i> relieve my mind, Mr. Rosedew?”</p>

<p>Here Georgie held out the most beautiful hand
that ever darned a dish&ndash;cloth, so white, and warm,
and dainty, from her glove and pink muff&ndash;lining.
Mr. Rosedew, of course, was compelled to take it,
and she left it a long time with him.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will, if it is in my power, and
you will only tell me how.”</p>

<p>“It is simply this,” she answered, meekly, dropping
her eyes, and sighing; “I do so long to do
good works, and never can tell how to set about it.
Unhappily, I am brought so much more into contact
with the worldly&ndash;minded, than with those who
would improve me, and I feel the lack of something,
something sadly deficient in my spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
state. Could you assign me a district anywhere?
I am sadly ignorant, but I might do some little
ministering, feeling as I do for every one. If it
were only ten cottages, with an interesting sheep&ndash;stealer!
Oh, that would be so charming. Can I
have a sheep&ndash;stealer?”</p>

<p>“I fear I cannot accommodate you”&mdash;the parson
was smiling in spite of himself, she looked so
beautifully earnest; “we have no felons here, and
scarcely even a hen&ndash;stealer. Though I must not
take any credit for that. Every house in the
village is Sir Cradock Nowellʼs, and Mr. Garnet is
not long in ousting the evil&ndash;doers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Cradock; poor Sir Cradock!” Here
she came to the real object of her expedition.
“Oh, Mr. Rosedew, tell me kindly, as a Christian
minister; I am in so difficult a position,&mdash;have
you noticed in poor Sir Cradock anything strange
of late, anything odd and lamentable?”</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedew hated to be called a “minister,”&mdash;the
Dissenters love the word so, and even the
great John had his weaknesses.</p>

<p>“I trust I should tell you the truth, Mrs.
Corklemore, whether invoked as a minister, or
asked simply as a man.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you would&mdash;of course you would. I
am always making such mistakes. I am so unused
to clever people. But do tell me, in any capacity
which may suit you best”&mdash;it was foolish of her
not to forego that little repartee&mdash;”whether you
have observed of late anything odd and deplorable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
anything we who love him so&mdash;&mdash;” Here she
hesitated, and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>“Though Sir Cradock Nowell,” replied Mr.
Rosedew, slowly, and buttoning up his coat at the
risk of spoiling his cockʼs&ndash;comb frill, “is no longer
my dearest friend, as he was for nearly fifty years,
it does not become me to speak about him confidentially
and disparagingly to a lady whom I have
not had the honour of seeing more than four times,
including therein the celebration of Divine service,
at which a district&ndash;visitor should attend with <i>some</i>
regularity, if only for the sake of example. Mrs.
Corklemore, I have the honour of wishing you
good morning.”</p>

<p>Although the parson had neither desire nor power
to pierce the ladyʼs schemes, he felt, by that peculiar
instinct which truly honest men have (though they
do not always use it), that the lady was dishonest,
and dishonestly seeking something. Else had he
never uttered a speech so unlike his usual courtesy.
As for poor simple Georgie, she was rolled over too
completely to do anything but gasp. Then she
went to the gorse to recover herself; and presently
she laughed, not spitefully, but with real amusement
at her own discomfiture.</p>

<p>Being quite a young woman still, and therefore
not <i>spe longa</i>, and feeling a want of sympathy in
waiting for dead menʼs shoes, Mrs. Corklemore,
who had some genius&mdash;if creative power prove it;
if <i>gignere</i>, not <i>gigni</i>, be taken as the test, though
perhaps it requires both of them,&mdash;that sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
mother of a sweeter child (if so much of the saccharine
be admitted by Chancellors of the Exchequer,
themselves men of more alcohol), what did
she do but devise a scheme to wear the shoes, <i>ipso
vivo</i>, and put the old gentleman into the slippers.</p>

<p>How very desirable it was that Nowelhurst Hall,
and those vast estates, should be in the possession
of some one who knew how to enjoy them, and
make a proper use of them! Poor Sir Cradock
never could do so; it was painfully evident that he
never more could discharge his duties to society,
that he was listless, passive, somnolent,&mdash;somnambulant
perhaps she ought to say, a man walking
in a dream. She had heard of cases,&mdash;more than
that, she had actually known them,&mdash;sad cases in
which that pressure on the brain, which so frequently
accompanies the slow reaction from sudden
and terrible trials, had crushed the reason altogether,
especially after a “certain age.” What a
pity! And it might be twenty years yet before it
pleased God to remove him. He had a tough and
wiry look about him. In common kindness and
humanity, something surely ought to be done to
relieve him, to make him happier.</p>

<p>Nothing rough, of course; nothing harsh or
coercive. No personal restraint whatever, for the
poor old dear was not dangerous; only to make
him what she believed was called a “Committee
in Chancery”&mdash;there she was wrong, for the guardian
is the Committee&mdash;and then Mr. Corklemore,
of course, and Mr. Kettledrum would act for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
At least she should think so, unless there was some
obnoxious trustee, under his marriage&ndash;settlement.
That settlement must be got at; so much depended
upon it. Probably young Cradock would succeed
thereunder to all the settled estate upon his fatherʼs
death. If so, there was nothing for it, except to
make him incapable, by convicting him of felony.
Poor fellow! She had no wish to hang him. She
would not have done it for the world; and she had
heard he was so good&ndash;looking. But there was no
fear of his being hanged, like the son of a tradesman
or peasant.</p>

<p>Well, when he was transported for life, with
every facility for repentance, who would be the
next to come bothering? Why, that odious Eoa.
As for her, she would hang her to&ndash;morrow, if she
could only get the chance. Though she believed
it would never hurt her; for the child could stand
upon nothing. Impudent wretch! Only yesterday
she had frightened Georgie out of her life
again. And there was no possibility of obtaining
a proper influence over her. There was hardly
any crime which that girl would hesitate at, when
excited. What a lamentable state of morality!
She might be made to choke Amy Rosedew, her
rival in Bobʼs affection. But no, that would never
do. Too much crime in one family. How would
society look upon them? And it would make the
house unpleasant to live in. There was a simpler
way of quenching Eoa&mdash;deny at once her legitimacy.
The chances were ten to one against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
having been born in wedlock&mdash;such a loose, wild
man as her father was. And even if she had been,
why, the chances were ten to one against her being
able to prove it. Whereas it would be very easy
to get a few Hindoos, or Coolies, or whatever they
were, to state their opinion about her mother.</p>

<p>Well, supposing all this nicely managed, what
next? Why, let poor Sir Cradock live out his
time, as he would be in her hands entirely, and
would grow more and more incapable; and when
it pleased God to release him, why then, “thou and
Ziba divide the land,” and for the sake of her dear
little Flore, she would take good care that the
Kettledrums did not get too much.</p>

<p>This programme was a far bolder one than that
with which Mrs. Corklemore had first arrived at
the Hall. But she was getting on so well, that of
course her views and desires expanded. All she
meant at first was to gain influence over her host,
and irrevocably estrange him from his surviving
son, by delicate insinuations upon the subject of
fratricide; at the same time to make Eoa do something
beyond forgiveness, and then to confide the
reward of virtue to obituary gratitude.</p>

<p>Could anything be more innocent, perhaps we
should say more laudable? What man of us has
not the privilege of knowing a dozen Christian
mothers, who would do things of nobler enterprise
for the sake of their little darlings?</p>

<p>But now, upon the broader gauge which the
lady had selected, there were two things to be done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ere ever the train got to the switches. One was,
to scatter right and left, behind and before, and
up and down, wonder, hesitancy, expectation, interrogation,
commiseration, and every other sort of
whisper, confidential, suggestive, cumulative, as to
poor Sir Cradockʼs condition. The other thing
was to find out the effect in the main of his marriage&ndash;settlement.
And this was by far the more
difficult.</p>

<p>Already Mrs. Corklemore had done a little business,
without leaving a tongue&ndash;print behind her, in
the distributory process; and if Mr. Rosedew
could just have been brought, after that rude dismissal,
to say that he had indeed observed sad
eccentricity, growing strangeness, on the part of
his ancient friend, why then he would be committed
to a line of most telling evidence, and the
parish half bound to approval.</p>

<p>But Johnʼs high sense of honour, and low dislike
of Georgie, had saved him from the neat, and
neatly&ndash;baited, trap.</p>

<p>That morning Mr. Rosedewʼs path was beset
with beauty, though his daughter failed to meet
him; inasmuch as she very naturally awaited him
on the parish road. When he had left the chase,
and was fetching a compass by the river, along a
quiet footway, elbowed like an old oak&ndash;branch,
overlapped with scraggy hawthorns, paved on
either side with good intention of primroses, there,
just in a nested bend where the bank overhangs
the stream, and you would like to lie flat and flip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in a trout fly about the end of April, over the
water came lightly bounding, and on a mossy bank
alighted, young Eoa Nowell.</p>

<p>“To and fro, thatʼs the way I go; donʼt you
see, Uncle John, I must; only the water is so narrow.
It scarcely keeps me in practice.”</p>

<p>“Then your standard, my dear, must be very
high. I should have thought twice about that
jump, in my very best days!”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> indeed!” said Eoa, with the most complacent
contempt; eyeing the parsonʼs thick&ndash;set
figure and anterior development.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” replied John, with a laugh, “it
is but seven and forty years since I won first prize
at Sherborne, both for the long leap and the high
leap; and proud enough I was, Eoa, of sixteen feet
four inches. But I should have had no chance,
thatʼs certain, if you had entered for the stakes.”</p>

<p>“But how could I be there, Uncle John, donʼt
you see, thirty years before I was born?”</p>

<p>“My dear, I am quite prepared to admit the
validity of your excuse. Tyrio cothurno! child,
what have you got on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I found them in an old cupboard, with
tops, and whips, and whistles; and I made Mother
Biddy take them in at the ancle, because I do hate
needles so. And I wear them, not on account of
the dirt, but because people in this country are so
nasty and particular; and now they canʼt say a
word against me. Thatʼs one comfort, at any
rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>She wore a smart pair of poor Claytonʼs vamplets,
and a dark morning&ndash;frock drawn tightly in,
with a little of the skirt tucked up, and a black
felt hat with an ostrich feather, and her masses
of hair rolled closely. As the bright colour shone
in her cheeks, and the heartlight outsparkled the
sun in her eyes, John Rosedew thought that he
had never seen such a wildly beautiful, and yet
perfectly innocent, creature.</p>

<p>“Well, I donʼt know,” he answered, very gravely,
“about your gaiters proving a Palladium against
calumny. But one thing is certain, Eoa, your
face will, to all who look at you. But why donʼt
you ride, my dear child, if you must have such
rapid exercise?”</p>

<p>“Because they wonʼt let me get up the proper
way on a horse. Me to sit cramped up between
two horns, as if a horse was a cow! Me, who can
stand on the back of a horse going at full gallop!
But it doesnʼt matter now much. Nobody seems
to like me for it.”</p>

<p>She spoke in so wistful and sad a tone, and cast
down her eyes so bashfully, that the old man, who
loved her heartily, longed to know what the matter
was.</p>

<p>“Nobody likes you, Eoa! Why, everybody
likes you. You are stealing everybodyʼs heart.
My Amy would be quite jealous, only she likes
you so much herself.”</p>

<p>“I am sure, I have more cause to be jealous of
her. Some people like me, I know, very much;
but not the people I want to do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you donʼt want us to do it. What
harm have we done, Eoa?”</p>

<p>“You donʼt understand me at all, Uncle John.
And perhaps you donʼt want to do it. And yet I
did think that you ought to know, as the clergyman
of the parish. But I never seem to have right ideas
of anything in this country!”</p>

<p>“Tell me, my dear,” said Mr. Rosedew, taking
her hand, and speaking softly, for he saw two
great tears stealing out from the dark shadow of
her lashes, and rolling down the cheeks that had
been so bright but a minute ago; “tell me, as if
you were my own daughter, what vexes your pure
heart so. Very likely I can help you, and I will
promise to tell no one.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Uncle John, you never can help me.
Nobody in the world can help me. But do you
think that you ought to know?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon the subject, my dear. Not
if it is a family&ndash;secret, or otherwise out of my
province. But if it is anything with which I have
to deal, or which I understand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, oh yes! Because you manage, you
manage all&mdash;all the banns of matrimony.”</p>

<p>This last word was whispered with such a sob of
despairing tantalization, that John, although he was
very sorry, could scarcely keep from laughing.</p>

<p>“You need not laugh, Uncle John. You
wouldnʼt if you were in my place, or could at all
understand the facts of it. And as for its being a
family&ndash;secret, ever so many people know it, and I
donʼt care two pice who knows it now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then let me know it, my child. Perhaps an
old man can advise you.”</p>

<p>The child of the East looked up at him, with a
mist of softness moving through the brilliance of
her eyes, and spake these unromantic words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is that I do like Bob so; and he doesnʼt
care one bit for me.”</p>

<p>She looked at the parson, as much as to say,
“What do you think of that, now? I am not at
all ashamed of it.” And then she stooped for a
primrose bud, and put it into his button&ndash;hole, and
then she burst out crying.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” said John, “upon my word,
this is too bad of you, Eoa.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know all that; and I say it to myself
ever so many times. But it seems to make no
difference. You canʼt understand, of course, Uncle
John, any more than you could jump the river.
But I do assure you that sometimes it makes me
feel quite desperate. And yet all the time I know
how excessively foolish I am. And then I try to
argue, but it seems to hurt me here. And then I
try not to think of it, but it will come back again,
and I am even glad to have it. And then I begin
to pity myself, and to be angry with every one else;
and after that I get better and whistle a tune, and
go jumping. Only I take care not to see him.”</p>

<p>“There you are quite right, my dear: and I
would strongly recommend you not to see him for
a month.”</p>

<p>“As if that could make any difference! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he would go and have somebody else. And then I
should kill them both.”</p>

<p>“Well done, Oriental! Now, will you be guided
by me, my dear? I have seen a great deal of the
world.”</p>

<p>“Yes, no doubt you have, Uncle John. And
you are welcome to say just what you like; only
donʼt advise me what I donʼt like; but tell the
truth exactly.”</p>

<p>“Then what I say is this, Eoa: keep away from
him altogether&mdash;donʼt allow him to see you, even
when he wishes it, for a month at least. Hold
yourself far above him. He will begin to think of
you more and more. Why, you are ten times too
good for him. There is not a man in England
who might not be proud of you, Eoa, when you
have learned a little dignity.”</p>

<p>Somehow or other none of the Rosedews appreciated
the Garnets.</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say; but donʼt you see, I donʼt
want him to be proud of me. I only want him to
like me. And I do hate being dignified.”</p>

<p>“If you want him to like you, do just what I
have advised.”</p>

<p>“So I will, Uncle John. Kiss me now, to make
it up. Oh, you are such a dear!&mdash;donʼt you think
a week would do, now?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="p2">At high noon of a bright cold day in the early
part of March, a labourer who had been “frithing,”
that is to say, cutting underwood in one of the
forest copses, came out into the green track, which
could scarce be called a “lane,” to eat his well&ndash;earned
dinner.</p>

<p>As it happened to be a Monday, the poor man
had a better dinner than he would see or smell
again until the following Sunday. For there, as
throughout rural England, a working man, receiving
his wages on the Saturday evening, lives
upon a sliding scale throughout the dreary week.
He has his bit of hot on Sunday, smacking his
lips at every morsel; and who shall scold him for
staying at home to see it duly boiled, and feeling
his heart move with the steaming and savoury pot&ndash;lid
more kindly than with the dry parson?</p>

<p>And he wants his old woman ‘long of him; he
see her so little all the week, and she be always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
best&ndash;tempered on Sundays. Let the young uns go
to school to get larning&mdash;though he donʼt much see
the use of it, and his father lived happy without it&mdash;‘bating
that matter, which is beyond him, let
them go, and then hear parson, and bring home
the news to the old folk. Only let ‘em come home
good time for dinner, or they had best look out.
“Now, Molly, lift the pot&ndash;lid again. Oh, it do
smell so good! Got ever another onion?”</p>

<p>Having held high feast on Sunday, and thanked
the Lord, without knowing it (by inhaling happiness,
and being good to the children&mdash;our Lordʼs
especial favourites), off he sets on the Monday
morning, to earn another eighteenpence&mdash;twopence
apiece for the young uns. And he means
to be jolly that day, for he has got his pinch of
tobacco and two lucifers in his waistcoat pocket,
and in his frail a most glorious dinner hanging
from a hedge&ndash;stake.</p>

<p>All the dogs he meets jump up on his back;
but he really cannot encourage them, with his own
dog so fond of bones, and having the first right to
them. Of course, his own dog is not far behind;
for it is a law of nature, admitting no exception,
that the poorer a man is, the more certain he is to
have a dog, and the more certain that dog is to
admire him.</p>

<p>Pretermitting the dog, important as he is, let us
ask of the masterʼs dinner. He has a great hunk
of cold bacon, from the cabbage&ndash;soup of yesterday,
with three short bones to keep it together, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
cross junk from the clod of beef (out of the same
great pot) which he will put up a tree for Tuesday;
because, if it had been left at home, mother
couldnʼt keep it from the children; who do scarce
a stroke of work yet, and only get strong victuals
to console them for school upon Sundays. Then
upon Wednesday our noble peasant of this merry
England will have come down to the scraping of
bones; on Thursday he may get bread and dripping
from some rich manʼs house; on Friday and
Saturday nothing but bread, unless there be cold
potatoes. And he will not have fed in this fat
rich manner unless he be a good workman, a hater
of public&ndash;houses, and his wife a tidy body.</p>

<p>Now this labourer who came out of the copse,
with a fine appetite for his Mondayʼs dinner (for
he had not been “spreeing” on Sunday), was no
other than Jem&mdash;not Jem Pottles, of course, but
the Jem who fell from the oak&ndash;branch, and must
have been killed or terribly hurt but for Cradock
Nowellʼs quickness. Everybody called him “Jem,”
except those who called him “father;” and his
patronymic, not being important, may as well continue
latent. Now why could not Jem enjoy his
dinner more thoroughly in the copse itself, where
the witheys were gloved with silver and gold, and
the primroses and the violets bloomed, and the first
of the wood&ndash;anemones began to star the dead ash&ndash;leaves?
In the first place, because in the timber&ndash;track
happen he might see somebody just to give
“good day” to; the chances were against it in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a lonesome place, still it might so happen; and a
man who has been six hours at work in the deep
recesses of a wood, with only birds and rabbits
moving, is liable to a gregarious weakness, especially
at feeding&ndash;time. Furthermore, this particular
copse had earned a very bad name. It was said to
be the harbourage of a white and lonesome ghost, a
ghost with no consideration for embodied feelings,
but apt to walk in the afternoon, in the glimpses
of wooded sunshine. Therefore Jem was very
uneasy at having to work alone there, and very
angry with his mate for having that day abandoned
him. And but that his dread of Mr. Garnet was
more than supernatural, he would have wiped his
billhook then and there, and gone all the way
to the public&ndash;house to fetch back that mate for
company.</p>

<p>Pondering thus, he followed the green track as
far as the corner of the coppice hedge, and then he
sat down on a mossy log, and began to chew more
pleasantly. He had washed his hands at a little
spring, and gathered a bit of watercress, and fixed
his square of cold bacon cleverly into a mighty
hunk of brown bread, like a whetstone in its
socket; and truly it would have whetted any plain
manʼs appetite to see the way he sliced it, and the
intense appreciation.</p>

<p>With his mighty clasp&ndash;knife (straight, not curved
like a gardenerʼs) he cut little streaky slips along,
and laid each on a good thickness of crust, and
patted it like a piece of butter, then fondly looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
at it for a moment, then popped it in, with the
resolution that the next should be a still better one,
supposing such excellence possible. And all the
while he rolled his tongue so, and smacked his
lips so fervently, that you saw the man knew
what he was about, dealt kindly with his hunger,
and felt a good dinner&mdash;when he got it.</p>

<p>“There, Scratch,” he cried to his dog, after
giving him many a taste, off and on, as in fairness
should be mentioned; “hie in, and seek it there,
lad.”</p>

<p>With that he tossed well in over the hedge&mdash;for
he was proud of his dogʼs abilities&mdash;the main bone
of the three (summum bonum from a canine point
of view; and, after all, perhaps they are right),
and the flat bone fell, it may be a rod or so, inside
the fence of the coppice. Scratch went through
the hedge in no time, having watched the course
of the bone in air (as a cricketer does of the ball,
or an astronomer of a comet) with his sweet little
tail on the quiver. But Scratch, in the coppice,
was all abroad, although he had measured the distance;
and the reason was very simple&mdash;the bone
was high up in the fork of a bush, and there it
would stay till the wind blew. Now this apotheosis
of the bone to the terrier was not proven; his
views were low and practical; and he rushed (as
all we earth&ndash;men do) to a lowering conclusion.
The bone must have sunk into ĕraʼs bosom, being
very sharp at one end, and heavy at the other.
The only plan was to scratch for it, within a limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
area; and why was he called “Scratch,” but for
scarifying genius?</p>

<p>Therefore that dog set to work, in a manner
highly praiseworthy (save, indeed, upon a flowerbed).
First he wrought well with his fore&ndash;feet,
using them at a trot only, until he had scooped out
a little hole, about the size of a ratʼs nest. This
he did in several places, and with sound assurance,
but a purely illusory bonus. Presently he began
in earnest, as if he had smelled a rat; he put out
his tongue and pricked his ears, and worked away
at full gallop, all four feet at once, in a fashion
known only to terriers. Jem came through the
hedge to see what it was, for the little dog gave
short barks now and then, as if he were in a rabbit&ndash;hole,
with the coney round the corner.</p>

<p>“Mun there, mun, lad; show whutt thee carnst
do, boy.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Scratch went on, emulative
of self&ndash;burial, throwing the soft earth high in the
air, and making a sort of laughing noise in the
rapture of his glory.</p>

<p>After a while he sniffed hard in the hole, and
then rested, and then again at it. The master
also was beginning to share the little dogʼs excitement,
for he had never seen Scratch dig so hard
before, and his mind was wavering betwixt the
hope of a pot of money, and the fear of finding
the skeleton belonging to the ghost.</p>

<p>Scratch worked for at least a quarter of an hour,
and then ran to the ditch and lapped a little, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
came back to work again, while Jem stood by at a
prudent distance, and puffed his pipe commensurately,
and wished he had somebody with him.
Presently he saw something shining in the peaty
and sandy trough, about two feet from the surface,
something at which Scratch tried his teeth, but
found the subject ungenial. So Jem ran up,
making sure this time that it was the pot of money.
Alas, it was nothing of the sort, nothing at all
worth digging for. Jem was so bitterly disappointed
that he laid hold of Scratch, and cuffed
him well, and the little dog went away and howled,
and looked at his bleeding claws, and stood penitent,
with his tail down.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the thing dug up had cost some
money in its time, for gunmakers know the way
to charge, if never another soul does. It was a
pair of gun&ndash;barrels, without any stock, or lock, or
ramrod, heavily battered and marked with fire, as
if an attempt had been made to burn the entire
implement, and then, the wood being consumed,
the iron parts had been kicked asunder, and the
hot barrels fiercely trampled on. Now Jem knew
nothing whatever of guns, except that they were
apt to go off, whether loaded or unloaded; so after
much ponderous thinking and fearing&mdash;<i>fiat experimentum
in corpore vili</i>&mdash;he summoned poor Scratch,
and coaxed him, and said, “Hie, boy, vetch thic
thur thinʼ!”</p>

<p>When he found that the little dog took the
barrels in his mouth without being hurt by them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and then dragged them along the ground, inasmuch
as he could not carry them, Jem plucked up
courage and laid them by, to take them home that
evening.</p>

<p>After his bit of supper that night, Jem and his
wife held counsel, the result of which was that he
took his prize down to Roger Sweetlandʼs shop, at
the lower end of the village. There he found the
blacksmith and one apprentice working overtime,
repairing a harrow, which must be ready for
Farmer Blackers next morning. The worthy
Vulcan received Jem kindly, for his wife was
Jemʼs wifeʼs second cousin; and then he blew up
a sharp yellow fire, and examined the barrels attentively.</p>


<p>“Niver zeed no goon the likes o’ thissom, though
a ‘ave ‘eered say as they makes ‘em now to shut
out o’ tʼother end, man. Whai, her hanʼt gat niver
na brichinʼ! A must shut the man as shuts wiʼ
her.”</p>

<p>“What wull e’ gie vor un, Roger? Her bainʼt
na gude to ussen.”</p>

<p>“Gie thee a zhillinʼ, lad, mare nor her be worth,
onʼy to bate up vor harse&ndash;shoon.”</p>

<p>After vainly attempting to get eightee&ndash;pence,
Jem was fain to accept the shilling; and this
piece of beautiful workmanship, and admirable
“Damascus twist,” was set in the corner behind
the door, to be forged into shoes for a cart&ndash;horse.
So, as Sophocles well observes, all things come
round with the rolling years: the best gun&ndash;barrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
used to be made of the stub&ndash;nails and the horse&ndash;shoes
(though the thing was a superstition); now
good horse&ndash;shoes shall be made out of the best gun&ndash;barrels.</p>

<p>But, in despite of this law of nature, those gun&ndash;barrels
never were made into horse&ndash;shoes at all,
and for this simple reason:&mdash;Rufus Hutton came
over from Nowelhurst to have his Polly shodden;
meanwhile he would walk up to the Hall, and see
how his child Eoa was. It is a most worshipful
providence, and as clever as the works of a watch,
that all the people who have been far abroad,
whether in hot or cold climates (I mean, of course,
respectively, and not that a Melville Bay harpooner
would fluke in with a Ceylon rifleman),
somehow or other, when they come home, groove
into, and dovetail with, one another; and not only
feel a <i>pudor</i> not to contradict a brother alien, but
feel bound by a <i>sacramentum</i> to back up the lies of
each other. To this rule of course there are some
exceptions (explosive accidents in the <i>Times</i>, for
instance), but almost every one will admit that it is
a rule; just as it is not to tell out of school.</p>

<p>As regards Rufus and Eoa, this association was
limited (as all of them are now&ndash;a&ndash;days, except in
their powers of swindling), strictly limited to a
keen and spicily patriarchal turn. Eoa, somehow
or other, with that wonderful feminine instinct
(which is far in advance of the canine, but not a
whit less jealous) felt that Rue Hutton had admired
her, though he was old enough to be her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
grandfather in those precocious climates. And
though she would not have had him, if he had
come out of Golconda mine, one stalactite of
diamonds, she really never could see that Rosa had
any business with him. Therefore, on no account
would she go to Geopharmacy Lodge, and she regarded
the baby, impending there, as an outrage
and an upstart.</p>

<p>Dr. Hutton knew more about shoeing a horse
than any of the country blacksmiths; and as
Polly, in common with many fast trotters, had a
trick of throwing her hind&ndash;feet inwards, and
“cutting” (as it is termed in the art), she liked to
have her hind&ndash;shoes turned up, and her hoofs
rasped in a peculiar manner, which Sweetland alone
could execute to her perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Ha, Roger, what have you got here?” said
Rufus, having returned from the Hall, and inspected
Pollyʼs new shoes, which she was very
proud to show him.</p>

<p>“Naethin’ at all, yer honour, but a bit o’ a old
anshent goon, as happed to coom in last avening.”</p>

<p>“Ancient gun, man! Why, it is a new breech&ndash;loader,
only terribly knocked about. I found it
all out in London. But there are none in this part
of the country. How on earth did you come by it?
And what made you spoil it, you stupid, in your
forge&ndash;fire?”</p>

<p>“Her hanʼt a bin in my varge&ndash;vire. If her had,
herʼd nivir a coom out alaive. Her hath bin in a
wood vire by the look o’ the smo&ndash;uk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Then Roger Sweetland told Rufus Hutton, as
briefly as it is possible for any New Forest man to
tell anything, all he knew about it; to which the
inquisitive doctor listened with the keenest interest.</p>

<p>“And what will you take for it, Sweetland?
Of course it is utterly ruined; but I might stick it
up in my rubbish&ndash;hole.”</p>

<p>“Iʼll tak whutt I gie vor ‘un; no mare, nor no
less. Though be warth a dale mare by the looks
ov ‘un.”</p>

<p>“And what did you give for it&mdash;twopence?”</p>

<p>“As good a croon&ndash;pace as wor iver cooined.
Putt un barck in carner, if a bainʼt worth thart.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hutton was glad to get it for that, but the
blacksmith looked rather blue when he saw him,
carefully wielding it, turn his mareʼs head towards
the copse where poor Jem was at work. For to
lose the doctorʼs custom would make his lie at four
shillings premium an uncommonly bad investment,
and Jem was almost sure to “let out” how much
he had got for the gun&ndash;barrels.</p>

<p>After hearing all that Jem had to say, and
seeing the entire process of discovery put dramatically,
and himself searching the spot most
carefully without any further result, and (which
was the main point of all, at least in Jemʼs opinion)
presenting the woodman with half&ndash;a&ndash;crown, and
bidding him hold his tongue, Rufus Hutton went
home, and very sagely preferred Harpocrates to
Hymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The which resolution was most ungrateful, for
Hymen had lately presented him with a perfect
little Cupid, according to the very best judges,
including the nurse and the mother, and the fuss
that was made at the Lodge about it (for to us men
a baby is neuter, a heterogeneous vocable, unluckily
indeclinable); really the way everybody
went on, and worst of all Rufus Hutton, was
enough to make a sane bachelor bless the memory
of Herod. However, of that no more at present.
Some one was quite awake to all the ridiculous
parts of it, and perfectly ready to turn it all to
profitable account, as an admirable reviewer treats
the feeble birth of a novel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemoreʼs sympathetic powers were
never displayed more brilliantly, or to better
effect; and before very long she had added one,
and that the primal, step to the ascending scale of
the amiable monarch. For she could manage
baby, and baby could manage Rosa, and Rosa
could manage Rufus. Only Rufus was not king
of the world, except in his own opinion.</p>

<p>As soon as Dr. Hutton could get away, he took
the barrels to his own little room, and examined
them very carefully. Scarred as they were, and battered,
and discoloured by the fire, there could be
no question as to their having formed part of a
patent breech&ndash;loading gun; even the hinge and
the bolt still remained, though the wooden continuation
of the stock was, of course, consumed;
moreover, there was no loop for ramrod, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
screw&ndash;thread to take the breeching. Then Rufus
went to a little cupboard, and took out a very
small bottle of a strong and rodent acid, and with
a feather slightly touched the battered, and crusted,
and rusty “bridge,” in the place where a gunmaker
puts his name, and for the most part
engraves it wretchedly. In breech&ndash;loading guns,
the bridge itself is only retained from the force of
habit, and our conservatism of folly; for as the
breech&ndash;end is so much thicker than the muzzle&ndash;end
of the barrel, and the interior a perfect cylinder,
the line of sight (if meddled with) should be raised
instead of being depressed at the muzzle&ndash;end, to
give us a perfect parallel. Of course we know
that shot falls in its flight, and there is no pure
point&ndash;blank; but surely the allowance for, and
correction of, these defeasances, according to
distance, &amp;c., should be left to the marksmanʼs
eye and practice, not slurred by a crossing of
planes at one particular distance.</p>

<p>Leaving that to wiser heads, which already are
correcting it (by omitting the bridge entirely), let
us see what Dr. Hutton did. As the acid began
to work, it was very beautiful to watch the clouding
and the clearing over the noble but fiercely&ndash;abused
metal. There is no time now to describe
it&mdash;for which readers will be thankful&mdash;enough
that the result revealed the makerʼs name and
address, “L&mdash;&mdash;, C&mdash;&mdash;r&ndash;street,” and the number
of the gun. Dr. Hutton by this time had made
the acquaintance of that eminent gunmaker, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
after improving greatly upon a French design,
had introduced into this country a rapid and
striking improvement; an implement of slaughter
as far in advance of the muzzle&ndash;loader as a lucifer&ndash;match
is of flint and tinder. And Rufus, although
with a set design to work out his suspicions, would
have found it a very much slower work, but for a
bit of accident.</p>

<p>He was sauntering along one day from Charing
Cross to the westward, looking in at every window
(as his manner was, for he loved all information),
when suddenly he espied the very “moral”&mdash;as the
old women say&mdash;the exact fac&ndash;simile of the thing
in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>Instantly he entered the shop, and asked a
number of questions. Though it was clear that he
came to purchase nothing, he was received most
courteously, for it is one of the greatest merits
of men who take the lead with us, that they scale
or skin the British dragon, and substitute for John
Bullʼs jumble of surliness and serfdom, the courtesy
of self&ndash;respect.</p>

<p>Then the brevity and simplicity of the new invention&mdash;for
everything is new with us during
five&ndash;and&ndash;twenty years; and it took thirty years of
persistent work to make Covent Garden own rhubarb&mdash;all
the great advantages, which true Britons
would “consider of,” were pointed out to Rufus
Hutton, and he saw them in a moment, though of
guns he had known but little.</p>

<p>And now he saw so much of import in his new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
discovery, that he resolved to neglect all other
business, and start for London the very next
morning, if Rosa could be persuaded to let him,
without having heard his purpose. But, in spite
of all his eagerness, he did nothing of the sort; for
Rufus junior that very night was taken with some
infantile ailment of a serious kind, and for more
than a month the doctor could not leave home for
a day even, without breach of duty towards his
wife, and towards the unconscious heir of his
orchard&ndash;house and pyramids.</p>

<p>Troubles were closing round Bull Garnet, but
he knew nothing of them; and, to tell the truth,
he cared not now what the end would be, or in
what mode it would visit him. All he cared for
was to defer (if it might be so) the violence of the
outburst, the ruin of the household, until his darling
son should be matured enough of judgment,
and shaped enough in character, to feel, and to
make others feel, that to answer for our own sins
is quite enough for the best of us.</p>

<p>Yet there was one other thing which Mr. Garnet
fain would see in likely course of settlement,
ere the recoil of his own crime should sweep upon
his children. It regarded only their worldly
affairs; their prospects, when he should have none.
And being the mixture he happened to be&mdash;so
shrewd, and so sentimental&mdash;he saw how good it
was to exert the former attributive, when his
children were concerned; and the latter, and far
larger one, upon the world at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>He had lately made some noble purchase from
the Government Commissioners&mdash;who generally
can be cheated, because what they sell is not their
own&mdash;and he felt that he was bound by the very
highest interests to be a capable grantee, till all
was signed, and sealed, and safely conveyed to
uses beyond attaint of felony. Therefore he was
labouring hard to infuse some of his old energy
into the breasts of lawyers&mdash;which attempt proves
the heat of his nature more than would a world of
testimony.</p>

<p>“Why does the mind so glide away to some calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sea of melancholy, when we stand and gaze intently
upon flowing water? And the larger the
spread of the water is, and the grander the march
of the current, the deeper and more irresistible
grows the sadness of the gazer.</p>

<p>“That naval captain, so well known as an explorer
of the Amazon, who dined with us at
Nowelhurst one day last July, was a light&ndash;hearted
man by nature, and full of wit and
humour. And yet, in spite of wine and warmth,
he made the summer twilight creep with the sadness
of his stories. Nevertheless, we hung upon
them with a strange enchantment; we drew more
real pleasure from them than from a world of
drolleries. Poor Clayton tried to run away, for he
never could bear melancholy; but all he did was
to take a chair nearer to the voyager. As for me,
I cried; in spite of myself, I cried; being carried
away by the flow of his language, so smooth, and
wide, and gliding, with the mystery of waters.</p>

<p>“And he was not one of those shallow men who
talk for effect at dinner&ndash;parties. Nothing more
than a modest sailor, leaving his mind to its natural
course. Only he had been so long upon that
mighty river, that he nevermore could cease from
gliding, ever gliding, with it.</p>

<p>“Once or twice he begged our pardon for the
sweep of hazy sadness moving (like the night on
water) through his tales and scenery. He is gone
there again of his own free choice. He must die
upon that river. He loves it more than any patriot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
ever loved his country. Betwixt a man and flowing
water there must be more than similitude, there
must be a sort of sympathy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Tap&ndash;Robin</i>, ahoy there! Ahoy, every son of
a sea&ndash;cook of you. Heave us over a rope, you
lubbers. Would yer swamp us with parson aboard
of me?”</p>

<p>This was Mr. Jupp, of course, churning up
Cradʼs weak ideas, like a steam&ndash;paddle in a fishpond.
Perhaps the reason why those ideas had
been of such sad obscurity, and so fluxed with
sorry sentiment, was that the vague concipient believed
himself to be shipped off for an indefinite
term of banishment, without even a message from
Amy. Whereas, in truth, he was only going for
a little voyage to Ceylon, in the clipper ship <i>Taprobane</i>,
A 1 for all time at Lloydʼs, and never allowed
to carry more than twice as much as she could.</p>

<p>How discontented mortals are! He ought to
have been jollier than a sandboy, for he had a
cabin all to himself (quite large enough to turn
round in), and, what of all things we Britons love
best, a happy little sinecure. He was actually appointed&mdash;on
the strength of his knowledge of goods
earned at the Cramjam terminus, but not through
any railway influence (being no chip of the board,
neither any attorneyʼs “love&ndash;child”&mdash;if there be
such a heterogeny), only through John Rosedewʼs
skill and knowledge of the world, Cradock was
actually made “under&ndash;supercargo” of a vessel
bound to the tropics.</p>

<p>The clipper had passed Greenhithe already, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
none had hailed her or said “Farewell.” The
<i>Taprobane</i> would have no tug. She was far too
clean in the bows for that work. Her mother and
grandmother had run unaided down the river;
even back to the fourth generation of ships, when
the Dutchmen held Ceylon, and doubtless would
have kept it, but for one great law of nature: no
Dutchman must be thin. But even a Dutchman
loses fat within ten degrees of the line. So
Nature reclaimed her square Dutchmen from the
tropics, which turned them over. Most likely
these regions are meant, in the end, for the
Yankee, who has no fat to lose, and is harder to
fry than a crocodile.</p>

<p>But who can stop to theorize while the <i>Taprobane</i>
is dancing along under English colours, and
swings on her keel just in time to avoid running
down Mr. Rosedew and Issachar? Mr. Jupp is
combining business with pleasure, being, as you
may say, under orders to meet the <i>Saucy Sally</i>, and
steer her home from Northfleet to the Surrey
Docks. So he has taken a lift in a collier, and
met Mr. Rosedew at Gravesend, according to
agreement, and then borrowed a boat to look out
alike for <i>Saucy Sally</i> and <i>Taprobane</i>.</p>

<p>When words and gifts had been interchanged&mdash;what
Amy sent is no matter now; but Loo Jupp
sent a penny ‘bacco&ndash;box, which beat fatherʼs
out and out (as he must be sure to tell Cradock),
and had “Am I welcome?” on it, in letters of gold
at least&mdash;when “God bless you” had been said for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the twentieth time, and love tied the tongue of
gratitude, the <i>Taprobane</i> lay&ndash;to for a moment, and
the sails all shivered noisily, and the water curled
crisply, and hissed and bubbled, and the little boats
hopped merrily to the pipe of the rising wind.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Rosedew came down the side, lightly
of foot and cleverly; while the under&ndash;supercargo
leaned upon the rail and sorrowfully watched him.
Ponderously then and slowly, with his great splay
feet thrust into the rope&ndash;ladder, even up to the
heel, quite at his leisure descended that good bargeman,
Issachar Jupp. This noble bargee had never
been seen to hurry himself on his own account.
He and his deeds lagged generally on the bight of
a long and slack tow&ndash;rope.</p>

<p>The sailors, not entering into his character,
thought that he was frightened, and condemned
his apprehensive luminaries, in words of a quarter
the compass. Then Mr. Jupp let go with both
hands, stood bolt upright on the foot&ndash;rope, and
shook his great fists at them. “Let him catch
them ashore at Wapping, if the devil forewent his
due; let him catch them, that was all!” Thereupon
they gave him a round of cheers, and promised
to square the account, please God.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedew and the bargeman looked up from
the tossing wherry, and waved their last farewell,
the parson reckless of Sunday hat, and letting his
white locks glance and flutter on the cold March
wind. But Cradock made no reply.</p>

<p>“All right, govʼnor!” said Jupp, catching hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the parson; “no call for you to take on so.
Iʼve a been the likes o’ that there mysel’ in the
days when I tuk’ blue ruin. The rattisination of
it are to fetch it out of him by travellinʼ. And the
<i>Tap&ndash;Robin</i> are a traveller, and no mistake. Dʼrectly
moment I comes to my fortinʼ, Iʼll improve self
and family travellinʼ.”</p>

<p>Zakey, to assert his independence as his nature
demanded, affected a rough familiarity with the
man whom he revered. The parson allowed it as
a matter of course. His dignity was not so hollow
as to be afraid of sand&ndash;paper. The result was that
Issachar Jupp, every time, felt more and more
compunction at, and less and less of comfort in,
the unresented liberties.</p>

<p>As he said “good&ndash;bye” at the landing&ndash;place&mdash;for
he had seen the <i>Sally</i> coming&mdash;he put out his
hand, and then drew it back with a rough bow
(disinterred from long&ndash;forgotten manners), and his
raspy tongue thrust far into the coal&ndash;mine of his
cheek. But John Rosedew accepted his hand, and
bowed, as he would have done to a nobleman.
Even if a baby smiled at him, John always acknowledged
the compliment. For he added Christian
courtesy, and the humility of all thoughtful minds,
to a certain grand and glorious gift of radiating
humanity.</p>

<p>Cradock Nowell was loth to be sent away, and
could not see the need of it; but doubtless the
medical men were right in prescribing a southern
voyage, a total change of scene and climate, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
likeliest means to re&ndash;establish the shattered frame
and the tottering mind. And so he sailed for the
gorgeous tropics, where the sun looks not askance,
where the size of every climbing, swimming, fluttering,
or crawling thing (save man himself) is
doubled; where life of all things bounds and
beats&mdash;until it is quickly beaten&mdash;as it never gets
warm enough to do in the pinching zones, tight&ndash;buckled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile John Rosedew went to his home&mdash;a
home so loved and fleeting&mdash;and tried to comfort
himself on the road with various Elzevirs. Finding
them fail, one after another, for his mind was
not in cue for them, he pulled out his little Greek
Testament, and read what a man may read every
day, and never begin to be weary; because his
heart still yearns the more towards the grand ideal,
and feels a reminiscence such as Plato the divine,
alone of heathens, won.</p>

<p>John Rosedew read once more the Sermon on
the Mount, and wondered how his little griefs
could vex him as they did. That sermon is grander
in English, far grander, than in the Greek; for
the genius of our language is large, and strong,
and simple&mdash;the true spirit of the noblest words
that ever on earth were spoken. How cramped
they would be in Attic Greek (like Mount Athos
chiselled); in Latin how nerveless and alien!
Ours is the language to express; and ours the race
to receive them.</p>

<p>What man, in later life, whose reading has led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
him through vexed places&mdash;whence he had wiser
held aloof&mdash;does not, on some little touch, brighten,
and bedew himself with the freshness of the morning,
thrill as does the leaping earth to see the sun
come back again, and, dashing all his night away,
open the power of his eyes to the kindness of his
Father?</p>

<p>John Rosedew felt his cares and fears vanish
like the dew&ndash;cloud among the quivering tree&ndash;tops;
and bright upon him broke the noon, the heaven
wherein our God lives. Earth and its fabrics may
pass away; but that which came from heaven shall
not be without a home.</p>

<p>Meditating, comforted, strengthened on the way,
John Rosedew came to his little hearth, and was
gladdened again by little things, such as here are
given or lent us to amuse our exile life. Most of
us, with growing knowledge and keener sense of
honesty, more strongly desire from year to year
that these playthings were distributed more equally
amongst us. But let us not say “equably.” For
who shall impugn the power of contrast even in
heightening the zest of heaven?</p>

<p>Amy met him, his own sweet Amy, best and
dearest of all girls, a thoroughly English maiden,
not salient like Eoa, but warmly kind, and thoughtful,
and toned with self&ndash;restraint. But even that
last she threw to the winds when she saw her
father returning, and ran with her little feet
pattering, like sweet&ndash;gale leaves, over the gravel,
to the unpretentious gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Darling father!” was all she said; and perhaps
it was quite enough.</p>

<p>Of late she had dropped all her little self&ndash;will
(which used to vex her aunt so), and her character
seemed to expand and ripen in the quiet glow of
her faithful love.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, and for nearly a fortnight, Amy
Rosedew, if suddenly wanted, was sure to be found
in a garret, whose gable&ndash;window faced directly
towards the breadth of sea. When a call for her
came through the crazy door, she would slam up
with wonderful speed her own little Munich telescope,
having only two slides and a cylinder, but
clearer and brighter than high&ndash;powered glasses,
ten stories long perhaps, and of London manufacture:
and then she would confront the appellant,
with such a colour to be sure, and a remark upon
the weather, as sage as those of our weather&ndash;clerks,
who allow the wind so much latitude that they
never contrive to hit it. But which of the maids
knew not, and loved her not the more for knowing,
that she was a little coast&ndash;guard, looking out for
her <i>eau de vie</i>? Of course she saw fifty <i>Taprobanes</i>&mdash;every
one more genuine than its predecessor&mdash;and
more than fifty Cradocks, some thirty miles
away, leaning over hearts of oak, with a faint sweet
smile, waving handkerchiefs as white as their own
unsullied constancy, and crying with a heavy sigh,
“My native land, good night!”</p>

<p>Facts, however, are stubborn things, and will
not even make a bow to the sweetest of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ladies. And the fact was that the Ceylon trader
fetched away to the southward before a jovial
north&ndash;east wind, and, not being bound to say anything
to either Plymouth or Falmouth, never came
near the field of gentle Amyʼs telescope.</p>

<p>That doctor knew something of his subject&mdash;the
triple conglomerate called man&mdash;who prescribed
for Cradock Nowell, instead of noxious medicines&mdash;<i>medicina
a non medendo</i>&mdash;the bounding ease and
buoyant freedom of a ship bound southward.</p>

<p>Go westward, and you meet the billows, headers
all of them, staggering faith even in the Psalmistʼs
description (for he was never in the Bay of Biscay),
and a wind that stings patriotic tears with the everlasting
brine. Go eastward, and you meet the ice,
or (in summer) shoals and soundings, and a dreary
stretch of sand&ndash;banks. Go northward, and the
chances are that you find no chance of return.
But go full&ndash;sail to the glorious south, and once
beyond the long cross&ndash;ploughings and headland of
the Gulf Stream, you slide into a quiet breast, a
confidence of waters, over which the sun more duly
does his work and knows it, and under which the
growth of beauty clothes your soul with wonder.</p>

<p>When shall we men leave off fighting, cease to
prove the Darwinian theory, and the legends of
Kilkenny (by leaving only our tails behind us, a
legacy for new lawsuits); and in the latter days
ask God the reason we were made for? When our
savage life is done with, and we are no longer cannibals&mdash;and
at present cannibals are perhaps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
more practical mind than we, for they have an
object in homicide, and the spit justifies the
battle&ndash;field&mdash;when we do at last begin not to hate
one another; not to think the evil first, because in
nature prior; not to brand as maniacs, and marks
for paltry satire, every man who dares to think
that he was not born a weasel, and that ferocity
is cowardice&mdash;then a man of self&ndash;respect may
begin to be a patriot. At present, as our nations
are, all abusing one another, none inquiring, none
allowing, all preferring wrong to weakness, if it hit
the breed and strain; each proclaiming that it is
the favoured child of God, the only one He looks
upon (merging His all&ndash;seeing eye in its squint
ambition)&mdash;at present even we must feel that
“patriotism” is little more than selfishness in a
balloon.</p>

<p>Poor Cradock, wasted so and altered (when he
left black London) that nothing short of womanʼs
true love could run him home without check,
began to feel the change of sky, and drink new
health from the balmy air, and relish the wholesome
mind&ndash;bread, leavened with the yeast of
novelty. A man who can stay in the same old
place, and work the blessed old and new year at
the same old work, dwell on and deal with the
same old faces, receive and be bound to reciprocate
the self&ndash;same old ideas, without crying out, “Oh
bother you!” without yearning for the sea&ndash;view, or
pining for the mountain&mdash;that man has either a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
great mind, or else he has none at all. For a very
great mind can create its own food, fresh as the
manna, daily, or dress in unceasing variety the
fruit of other intellects, and live thereon amid
the grand and ever&ndash;shifting scenery of a free
imagination. On the other hand, a man of no
mind gets on quite contentedly, having never
tasted thought&ndash;food; only wind him up with the
golden key every Saturday night, and oil him with
respectability at the Sunday service.</p>

<p>Now the under&ndash;supercargo of the <i>Taprobane</i>
was beginning to eat his meals like a man, to be
pleased with the smell of new tar, and the head&ndash;over&ndash;heel
of the porpoises, and to make acquaintance
with sailors of large morality. In a word, he
was coming back, by spell and spate, to Cradock
Nowell, but as yet so merely skew&ndash;nailed to the
pillar of himself, that any change of weather caused
a gape, a gap, a chasm.</p>

<p>Give him bright sun and clear sky, with a gentle
breeze over the water spreading wayward laughter,
with an amaranth haze just lightly veiling the
union of heaven and ocean, and a few flying&ndash;fish,
or an albatross, for incident in the foreground&mdash;and
the young man would walk to and fro as
briskly, and talk as clearly and pleasantly, as any
one in the ship could.</p>

<p>But let the sky gather weight and gloom, and
the sullen sun hang back in it, and the bright flaw
of wind on the waters die out, and the sultry air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in oppressive folds, lean on the slimy ocean&mdash;and
Cradockʼs mind was gone away, like a bat flown
into darkness.</p>

<p>Sometimes it went more gradually, giving him
time to be conscious that his consciousness was
departing; and that of all things was perhaps the
most woeful and distressing. It was as if the weak
mind&ndash;fountain bubbled up reproachfully, like a
geyser over&ndash;gargled, and flushed the thin membrane
and cellular tissue with more thought than they
could dispose of. Then he felt the air grow chill,
and saw two shapes of everything, and fancied he
was holding something when his hands were
empty. Then the mind went slowly off, retreating,
ebbing, leaving shoal&ndash;ground, into long abeyance,
into faintly&ndash;known bayous, feebly navigated
by the nautilus of memory.</p>

<p>It is not pleasant, but is good, now and then to
see afar these pretty little drawbacks upon our
self&ndash;complacency&mdash;an article imported hourly,
though in small demand for export. However,
that is of little moment, for the home consumption
is infinite. How noble it is to vaunt ourselves,
how spirited to scorn as <i>faber</i> Him who would be
father; when a floating gossamer breathed between
the hemispheres of our brain makes imperial
reason but the rubbish of an imperious
flood. Then the cells and clever casemates,
rammed home with explosive stuff to blow God
out of heaven, are no mortar, but a limekiln,
crusted and collapsing (after three days’ fire), a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stranded cockle, dead and stale, with the door of
his shell a bubble; and so ends the philosopher.</p>

<p>Upon a glaring torpid sea, a degree or two south
of the line, the <i>Taprobane</i> lay so becalmed that the
toss of a quid into the water was enough to drive
her windward, or leeward, whichever you pleased
to call it. The last of the trade winds, being long
dead, was buried on the log by this time; and the
sailors were whistling by day and by night, and
piping into the keys of their lockers; but no responsive
dimple appeared in the sleek cadaverous
cheek of the never&ndash;changing sea.</p>

<p>What else could one expect? They had passed
upon the windʼs&ndash;eyes so adverse a decision&mdash;without
hearing counsel on either side&mdash;that really, to
escape ophthalmia, it must close its eyelids. So
everything was heavy slumber, sleep of parboiled
weariness. Where sea and sky met one another&mdash;if
they could do it without moving&mdash;the rim of
dazzled vision whitened to a talc&ndash;like glimmer.
Within that circle all was tintless, hard as steel,
yet dull and oily, smitten flat with heat and haze.
Not a single place in sky and sea to which a man
might point his finger, and say to his mate, “Look
there!” No skir of fish, not even a sharkʼs fin, or
a mitching dolphin, no dip of wing, no life at all,
beyond the hot rim of the ship, or rather now the
“vessel,” where many a man lay frying, with
scarcely any lard left. And oh, how the tar and
the pitch did smell, running like a cankered
apricot&ndash;tree, and the steam of the bilge&ndash;water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
found its way up, and reeked through the yawning
deck&ndash;seams!</p>

<p>But if any man durst look over the side (being
gifted with an Egyptian skull, for to any thin head
the sunstroke is death, when taken upon the crown),
that daring man would have seen in blue water,
some twenty fathoms below him, a world of life,
and work, and taste, complex, yet simple, more ingenious
than his wisest labours. For here no rough
rivers profane the sea with a flood of turbulent
passion, like a foul oath vented upon the calm
summer twilight; neither is there strong indraught
from the tossing of distant waters, nor rolling
leagues of mountain surf, as in the Indian Ocean.
All is heat and sleep above, where the sheer dint
of the sun lies; but down in the depth of those
glassy halls they heed not the fervour of the noon&ndash;blaze,
nor the dewy sparkle of starlight.</p>

<p>“Typhoon by&ndash;and&ndash;by,” said the first mate, yawning,
but too lazy to stretch, under the awning
of a sail which they wetted with a hydropult, a
most useful thing on shipboard, as well as in a
garden.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” answered the captain, looking
still more lazy, but managing to suck cold punch.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” was all the mate said. It was
a deal too hot to argue, and he was actually
drinking ale, English bottled ale, hoisted up from
a dip in blue water, but as hot as the pipes in
a pinery.</p>

<p>The under&ndash;supercargo heeded not these laconic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
interchanges. The oppression was too great for
him. Amid that universal blaze and downright
pour of stifling heat, his mind was gone woolgathering
back into the old New Forest. The
pleasant stir of the stripling leaves, the shadows
weaving their morrice&ndash;dance, and trooping away
on the grass&ndash;tufts at the pensive steps of evening;
the sound and scent of the vernal wind among the
blowing gorse; the milky splash of the cuckoo&ndash;flower
in swarded breaks of woodland, the bees in
the belfry of cowslips, the frill of the white wind&ndash;flower,
and the fleeting scent of violets&mdash;all these
in their form and colour moved, or lay in their
beauty before him, while he was leaning against
the side&ndash;rail, and it burned his hand to touch it.</p>

<p>“Wants a wet swab on his nob,” said the first
mate, tersely; “never come to himself sure as my
name is Cracklins.”</p>

<p>“Donʼt agree with you,” answered the captain,
who always snubbed the mate; “heʼs a sight better
now than at Blackwall. Poor young gent, I like
him.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the mate, pouring out more
boiling beer; “but that ainʼt much to do with it.
Thereʼs the wet swab anyhow.”</p>

<p>About an hour before sunset, when the sky was
purple, and the hot vapours piling away in slow
drifts, like large haycocks walking, a gentle breeze
came up and made little finger&ndash;marks on the water.
First it awoke shy glances and glosses, light as the
play upon richly&ndash;glazed silk, or the glimpse upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mother&ndash;of&ndash;pearl. Then it breathed on the lips of
men, and they sucked at it as at spring&ndash;water.
Then it came sliding, curling, ruffling, breaking the
image of sky upon sea, but bringing earthly life
and courage, hope, and the spirit of motion. Many
a rough and gruff tar shed tears, not knowing the
least about them, only from natureʼs good&ndash;will and
power, as turpentine flows from the pine&ndash;wood.</p>

<p>“Hearty, my lads, and bear a hand.” “Pipe
my eye, and be blessed to me!” They rasped it
off with their tarry knuckles, and would knock
down any one of canine extraction, who dared to
say wet was the white of their eyes.</p>

<p>The gurgling of the water sounded like the sobs
of a sleeping child, as it went dapping and lipping
and lapping, under the bows and along the run of
the sweetly&ndash;gliding curvature. Soon you could see
the quiet closure of the fluid behind her, the fibreing
first (as of parted hair) convergent under the
counter, the dimples circling in opposite ways on
the right and left of the triangle, and then the
linear ruffles meeting, and spreading away in broad
white union, after a little jostling. You may see
the same at the tail of a mill&ndash;stream, when the
water is bright in July, and the alder&ndash;shade falls
across it. For the sails were beginning to draw
again now, and the sheets and tacks were tightening,
and the braces creaking merrily, and every bit
of man&ndash;stuff on board felt his heart go, and his
lungs work. Therefore all were glad and chaffing,
as the manner is of Britons, when the man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
foretop shouted down, “Land upon the port&ndash;bow.”</p>

<p>“I have looked for it all day,” said the captain;
“I was right to half a league, Smith.”</p>

<p>The skipper had run somewhat out of his
course to avoid a cyclone to the westward, but he
had not allowed sufficiently for the indraught of
the Gulf of Guinea, and was twenty leagues more
to the eastward than he had any idea of being.
Nevertheless, they had plenty of sea&ndash;room, and
now from the trending of the coast might prudently
stand due south. They had passed Cape
Lopez three days ago, of course without having
sighted it, and had run by the log three hundred
miles thence, despite the dead calm of that day.
So they knew that they could not be very far from
the mouth of the river Congo.</p>

<p>As they slipped along with that freshening
breeze, the water lost its brightness, and soon became
of a yellowish hue, as if mixed with a turbulent
freshet. Then they lay to in fifteen fathoms,
and sent off a boat to the island, for the intense
heat of the last few days had turned their water
putrid. The first and second mates were going,
and the supercargo took his gun, and declared that
he would stretch his legs and bring home some
game for supper. What island it was they were
not quite sure, for there was nothing marked on
the charts just there, to agree with their reckoning
and log&ndash;run. But they knew how defective charts
are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>When the water&ndash;casks were lowered, and all
were ready to shove off, and the mast of the yawl
was stepped, and the sail beginning to flap and
jerk in a most impatient manner, Cracklins, who
was a good&ndash;natured fellow, hollaed out to Cradock&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come along of us, Newman, old fellow. You
want bowsing up, I see. Bring your little dog for
a run, to rout up some rabbits or monkeys for
Tippler. And have a good run yourself, my
boy.”</p>

<p>Without stopping to think&mdash;for his mind that
day had only been a dream to him&mdash;Cradock
Nowell went down the side, with Wena on his
arm, and she took advantage of the occasion to
lick his face all over. Then he shuddered unconsciously
at the gun which lay under the transoms.</p>

<p>“Look sharp, Cracklins,” shouted the captain
from his window; “the glass is down, I see, half
an inch. I can only give you two hours.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” answered the mate; “but we
canʼt fill the casks in that time, unless we have
wonderful luck.”</p>

<p>The land lay about a mile away, and with the
sail beginning to tug, and four oars dipping
vigorously,&mdash;for the men were refreshed by the
evening breeze, and wild for a run on shore,&mdash;they
reached it in about ten minutes, and nosed her in
on a silvery beach strewn with shells innumerable.
A few dwarf rocks rose here and there, and the
line of the storms was definite, but for inland
view there was nothing more than a crescent terrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of palm&ndash;trees. The air felt beautifully fresh
and pure, and entirely free from the crawling
miasma of the African coast. No mangrove
swamps, no festering mud, no reedy bayou of
rottenness.</p>

<p>But the boat&ndash;crew found no fresh water at first;
and they went in three parties to search for it.
The mate with three men struck off to the right,
the boatswain with three more made away to the
left, only Cradock and the supercargo walked directly
inland. Wena found several rabbits, all of
a sandy colour, and she did enjoy most wonderfully
her little chivies after them. Most of the
birds were going to rest, as the rapid twilight fell,
but the trees were full of monkeys, and here and
there a squirrel shook the light tracery of the
branches.</p>

<p>Tippler and Cradock wandered inland for half a
mile or more, keeping along a pleasant hollow
which they feared to leave, lest they should lose
the way back, and as yet they had seen neither
spring nor brook, although from the growth and
freshness they knew that water must be near
them. Then suddenly the supercargo fired his
gun at a flying green pigeon, whose beauty had
caught his eyes.</p>

<p>To his great amazement Cradock fell down,
utterly helpless, pale as a corpse, not trembling,
but in a syncope. His comrade tried to restore
him, but without any effect, then managed to drag
him part way up the slope, and set him with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
back to an ebony&ndash;tree, while he ran to fetch assistance.
Suddenly then an ominous sound trembled
through the thick wood, a mysterious thrill of the
earth and air, at the coming of war between them.
It moved the wild grapes, the flowering creepers,
the sinuous caoutchouc, the yellow nuts of the
palm&ndash;oil&ndash;tree, and the pointed leaves of the ebony.</p>

<p>When the supercargo ran down to the boat, the
men were pushing off hastily, the water curling
and darkening, and a sullen swell increasing. A
heavy mass of cloud hung to leeward, and the tropical
night fell heavily, till the ship was swallowed
up in it.</p>

<p>“Jump in, Tippler! Just in time,” cried the
first mate, seizing the tiller&ndash;ropes; “not a moment
to lose. We must go without water; we shall have
enough out of the sky to&ndash;night. I could not tell
what to do about you, and the signalʼs ‘Return
immediately.’”</p>

<p>“But I tell you, we canʼt go, Cracklins. Poor
Newman is up there in a fit or something. Send
two men with me to fetch him.”</p>

<p>“How far off is he?”</p>

<p>“Nearly a mile.”</p>

<p>“Then I darenʼt do it. We are risking our lives
already. The typhoon will be on us in half an
hour. Said so this morning&mdash;skipper wouldnʼt
listen. Jump in, man, jump in; or weʼre off without
you. Canʼt you see how the sea is rising?
Ease off the sheet, you lubber there. We must
down with the sail in two minutes, lads, soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
ever weʼve got way on her. Lend a grip of your
black fist, Julep, instead of yawing there like a
nigger. Now will you come, or wonʼt you?”</p>

<p>Tippler was a brave and kind&ndash;hearted man; but
he thought of his wife and children, and leaped
into the boat. Although he was not a sailor, he
saw the urgency of the moment, and confessed
that nine lives must not be sacrificed for the sake
of one. The power of the wind was growing so
fast, and the lift of the waves so menacing, that
the nine men needed both skill and strength to
recover their ship, ere the storm burst.</p>

<p>And a terrible storm it was, of the genuine
Capricorn type, sudden, deluging, laced with blue
lightning, whirling in the opposite direction to that
which our cyclones take. At midnight the <i>Taprobane</i>
was running under bare poles, shipping great
seas heavily, with an electric coronet gleaming and
bristling all around truck and dog&ndash;vane. And by
that time she was sixty miles from her under&ndash;supercargo.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="p2">Dr. Huttonʼs baby was getting better, and
Rosa, who had been, as the nurse said, “losing
ground so sadly, poor dear,” was beginning to pick
up her crumbs again. Therefore Rufus, who (in
common with Rosa and all the rest of the household)
regarded that baby as the noblest and
grandest sublimation of humanity, if not as the
final cause of this little worldʼs existence, was beginning
now to make up his mind that he really
might go to London that week, without being (as
his wife declared he must be, if he even thought
about it) cruel, inhuman, unfatherly, utterly void
of all sense of duty, not to say common affection.
And she knew quite well what he wanted. All he
wanted was to go and see Mr. Riversʼs peach&ndash;trees
in blossom, as if that was such a sight as her baby.
Yes, <i>her</i> baby, maʼs own darling, a dove of a
dumpling dillikins; to think that his own pa should
prefer nasty little trees without a hair on them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and that didnʼt even know what bo meant, to the
most elegant love of a goldylocks that ever was,
was, was!</p>

<p>Master Goldylocks had received, from another
quarter, a less classical, and less pleasing, but perhaps
(from an objective point of view) a more
truthful and unprismatic description of the hair it
pleased God to give him.</p>

<p>“Governorʼs carrots, and no mistake,” cried
Mrs. OʼGaghan the moment she saw him, which,
of course, was upon his first public appearance&mdash;catch
Biddy out of the way when any baby, of
any father or mother she had ever heard of, was
submitted even to the most privileged inspection&mdash;”knew
he must have ‘em, of course. You niver
can conquer that, maʼam, if your own hair was
like a sloe, and you tuk me black briony arl the
time. Hould him dacent, will ye, nurse? Not
slot his head down that fashion! He donʼt want
more blood in his hair, child. Oh yes, I can see,
maʼam! Niver knowed more nor two wi’ that red&ndash;hot
poker colour, colour of the red snuff they calls
‘Irish blackguard’ in the top of a hot shovel;
and one of the two were Mr. Hutton, maʼam,
saving your presence to spake of it; and the other
were of Tim Brady, as were hung at the crossroads,
near Clonmel, for cutting the throat of his
grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary, take her away. What a horrid
woman!”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. OʼGaghan was marched away, amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
universal indignation, which she could not at all
understand. But she long had borne against Rufus
Hutton the bitterest of all bitter spites (such as
only an Irishwoman can bear), for the exposure
of her own great mistake, and the miserable result
which (as she fully believed) had sprung from all
his meddling. And yet she was a “good&ndash;hearted”
woman. But a good heart is only the wad upon
powder, when a violent will is behind it.</p>

<p>Not to attach undue importance to Biddyʼs prepossessions,
yet to give every facility for a verdict
upon the question, I am bound to state what an
old&ndash;young lady, growing every month more satirical,
because nobody would have her, yet quite
unconscious that the one drawback was the main
cause of the other (for all men hate sarcastic
women),&mdash;how tersely she expressed herself.</p>

<p>“Ridiculous likeness! Was he born with two
cheroots in his mouth?”</p>

<p>But a lady, who would marry for ever because
she was so soft and nice, came to see darling baby
again, the moment she was quite assured that he
was equal to the interview, having denied herself
from day to day, although it had affected her appetite,
and was telling upon her spirits. Neither
would she come alone&mdash;that would be too selfish:
she must make a gala day of it, and gratify her
relatives. So Mrs. Hutton had the rapture of
sitting behind her bedroom curtain, and seeing no
less than three carriages draw up in a thundering
manner, while Rufus was in the greatest fright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that they would not find room to turn, but must
cut up his turf. Luckily the roller was in the
way; or else those great coachmen, who felt themselves
lowered by coming to a place of that size,
would have had their revenge on the sod. The
three carriages were, of course, that of Nowelhurst
Hall in the van (no pun, if you please), with two
noble footmen behind it, and Georgie in state
inside. Then the “Kettledrum rattletrap,” as
the hypercritical termed it, with Mr. Kettledrum
driving, and striking statuesque attitudes for the
benefit of the horses, and Mrs. Kettledrum inside,
entreating him not to be rash. Last of all the
Coo Nest equipage, a very neat affair, with Mr.
Corklemore inside, wanting to look at his wife in
the distance, and wondering what she was up to.</p>

<p>“Oh, such shocking taste, I know,” cried
Georgie, directly the lower order were supposed
to be out of hearing, “horribly bad taste to come
in such force; but what could we do, Dr. Hutton?
There was my sister, there was my husband, there
was my own silly self, all waiting, as for a bulletin,
to know when baby would receive. And so, at
the very first moment, by some strange coincidence,
here we are all at once. And I do hope
darling Rosa will allow <i>some</i> of us to come in.”</p>

<p>“Jonah,” shouted Rufus Hutton, going away
to the door very rudely (according to our ideas,
but with Anglo&ndash;Indian instincts), “see that all
those men have beer.”</p>

<p>“Plaise, sir, there bainʼt none left. Brewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hainʼt a been since you drank.” As every one in the
house heard this, dear Georgie had some revenge.</p>

<p>However, babe Rufus received his ovation; and
the whole thing went off well, as most things do
in the counties of England, when plenty of good
wine produces itself. Lunch was ready in no time;
and, as all had long ago assented to Mrs. Corklemoreʼs
most unselfish proposition that she, as privileged
of pet Rosa, should just steal up&ndash;stairs for
a minute, and then come down again&mdash;after giving
notice, of course, that dear baby should have all
his lace on&mdash;the pleasant overture of the host was
accepted with little coyness&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let us suppose that we have dined: because
the roads are so very bad. Let us venture upon a
light dessert. I have a few pears, even now in
April, which I am not altogether afraid to submit
to the exquisite taste of ladies,&mdash;‘Madame Milletʼ
and ‘Josephine.’ May we think that we have
dined?”</p>

<p>As the company not only thought, but felt that
they had made an uncommonly good dinner, this
little proposal did pleasant violence to their sense
of time. It would be so charmingly novel to think
that they had dined at three oʼclock! Oh, people
of brief memory! For Kettledrum Hall and Coo
Nest loved nothing better than to dine at two;
which, perhaps, is two hours too late, according to
nature <i>versus</i> fashion.</p>

<p>“For such an occasion as this,” said Rufus,
under all the excitement of hospitality multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by paternity, “we will have a wine worth talking
of. Clicquot, of course, and Paxarette for the
ladies, if they prefer it; which perhaps they will
do because it is sweeter than port. But I do hope
that some will deign to taste my 1820, Presidentʼs
unrefreshed.”</p>

<p>Georgieʼs pretty lip came out, like the curl of an
opening convolvulus; to think of offering her sweet
wine, when choice port was forthcoming. There
are few better judges of a good glass of port than
Mrs. Nowell Corklemore.</p>

<p>“Port, sir, for my wife, if you please. She
likes a rather dry wine, sir, but with plenty of
bouquet. There is no subject, I may say, in
which she has&mdash;ha, haw&mdash;a more profound
capacity.”</p>

<p>“My dear Nowell, why you are perfectly calumnious.
Thank you, no champagne. It spoils the
taste of&mdash;your beautiful water. How dreadfully
we were alarmed in Ringwood. We all but drove
over a child. What a providential escape! I
have scarcely yet recovered it. It has made me
feel so nervous. What, Dr. Hutton, port for a
lady, at this time of day, and not ordered medically!”</p>

<p>Thereupon, of course Rufus prescribed it, till
Georgie, being quite overcome by the colour, as
the host himself decanted it, capitulated at last for
“strictly half a glass.”</p>

<p>After a little, the ladies withdrew, to see double
perfections in the baby, and Mrs. Hutton, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
knew quite well what they had been doing, while
she was discussing arrowroot, received them at first
rather stiffly. But she had no chance with Georgie,
who entered beautifully into the interesting room,
and exclaimed with great vivacity&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Mrs. Hutton, as the little boys say,
‘here we are again.’ And so glad to get away,
because your husband is so hospitable, and we
thought of you all the time. I wanted so much
to bring you a glass of that very exquisite&mdash;let
me see, I think it must have been port, though
I never know one wine from another&mdash;only I
feared it might seem rude, if I had ventured to
propose it. Of course Dr. Hutton knew best.”</p>

<p>“Of course he didnʼt,” said Rosa, pettishly;
“he never thought about it. Not that I would
have taken it; oh dear no! Ladies cannot have
too little wine, I think. It seems to make them so
masculine.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, you know best. Very likely you
heard us laughing. I assure you we were quite
merry. We drank his health ‘three times threeʼ&mdash;donʼt
they call it about a baby? And I was
nearly proposing <i>yours</i>; only a gentleman ought
to do that. Oh, it was so interesting, and the wine
superb&mdash;at least, so said the gentlemen; I do wish
they had brought you some, dear.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad they did not. It is so very
lowering to a fine sense of the ideal. I heard you
laughing, or making some noise; only I was so
absorbed in these lovely poems. ‘To my Babe’ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
so very beautiful, so expressive, so elevating! I
feel every single word of it. And this sonnet
about the first cropper! And the stanzas to his
little red shoes, terminating with ‘pinch his nose!’
You have had so many husbands, dear; you must
know all about it.”</p>

<p>“My darling child, how I feel for you! But,
in all probability, he will come up when both decanters
are empty; let him find you in a good
temper, dear.”</p>

<p>But this (which must have grown into a row,
for Georgie had even more spirit than tact, and
Rosa was equal to anything), all this evil was
averted, and harmony restored by the popping in
of nurse, who had not taken her half&ndash;crowns yet,
but considered them desirable, and saw them now
endangered.</p>

<p>“Goldylocks, Goldylocks! Oh, bring him here,
nurse. Skillikins, dillikins! oh, such a dove!
And if nobody else cares for poor mamma, he has
got so much better taste, hasnʼt he?”</p>

<p>Goldylocks very soon proved that he had; and
Georgie, having quite recovered her temper, admired
him so ecstatically, that even his mother
thought her judgment was really worth something.</p>

<p>“Give him to me; I canʼt do without him. O
you beautiful cherub! Kicklewick, I am sure you
never saw any one like him.”</p>

<p>“That indeed I never did, maʼam,” answered
nurse Kicklewick, holding her arms out, as if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
must have him back again; “many a fine child I
have seen, and done for to my humble ability,
maʼam, since the time I were at Lord Eldergunʼs;
and her ladyship said to me&mdash;ʼKicklewick,’ says
she&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, his love of a nosey&ndash;posey! Oh, then his
bootiful eyes, dick, dock! And then his golden
hair, you know, so lovely, chaste, and rare, you
know! Will um have a dancey&ndash;prancey?”</p>

<p>And Georgie, forgetting all dignity, went
through a little Polish dance, with the baby in her
arms, to his very grave amazement, and the delight
of all beholders.</p>

<p>Although of the genuine Hutton strain, he was
too young to crow yet, nevertheless he expressed
approval in the most emphatic water&ndash;colours.
Mrs. Huttonʼs heart was won for ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, darling, I am so obliged to you. He has
positively popped two bubbles. A thing he never
did before! How can I ever repay you?”</p>

<p>“By letting me come over and dance him twice
a week. Oh, that I only had a boy!&mdash;because I
do love boy&ndash;babies so.”</p>

<p>“One would think that you must have had fifty,
at least, before you were five&ndash;and&ndash;twenty! How
on earth do you understand him so? I only know
half what he means, though I try for hours and
hours.”</p>

<p>“Simply by sympathizing with him. I feel all
his ideas come home to me, and I put them into
shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“You are the loveliest creature I ever saw.”
And, indeed, Georgie did look very well, for it was
not all mere humbug now, though perhaps it was
at first. “Oh, no wonder baby loves you. Kicklewick,
isnʼt it wonderful?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, then, and it would be, maʼam,” replied
Mrs. Kicklewick, rapturously&mdash;for now she had
four half&ndash;crowns in her pocket&mdash;“only for it beinʼ
nature, maʼam. Nature it is as does it, as must
be. Nothing else no good again it. And how I
should like to beʼlong of you, maʼam, when your
next time come, please God. Would you mind to
accept of my card, maʼam, unpretenshome but in
good families,&mdash;Sarah Kicklewick, late to Lord
Eldergun, and have hopes to be again, maʼam, if
any confidence in head&ndash;footman. ‘Mrs. Kicklewick,’
he says, and me upon the bridge, maʼam,
with the wind a blowinʼ&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Georgie, “and the water
flowing; how clearly you describe it!”</p>

<p>But we must cut her short, even as she cut
nurse Kicklewick. Enough that she won such
influence over the kind but not too clever Rosa,
that Rufus Huttonʼs plans and acts, so far as they
were known to his wife, were known also to his wifeʼs
best friend. But one thing there was which Mrs.
Corklemore could not at all understand,&mdash;why
should he be going to London so, and wanting to
go again, in spite of domestic emergencies? She
very soon satisfied herself that Rosa was really in
the dark upon this point, and very indignant at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
being so. This indignation must be fostered and
pointed to a practical end. Mrs. Kettledrum, of
course, had been kept in the background all this
time, and scarcely allowed to dandle the baby, for
fear of impairing her sisterʼs triumph.</p>

<p>“How wonderfully kind and thoughtful of
you!” said Rosa, as Georgie came in again.
“Have you really brought me a glass of wine?
And no one else in the house to suppose that I
ought to have any nourishment! How can I
thank you, Mrs. Corklemore?”</p>

<p>“No more ‘Mrs. Corklemore,’ if you please. I
have begun to call you ‘Rosaʼ&mdash;it is such a pretty
name&mdash;and you must call me ‘Georgie,’ darling.
Every one does who loves me.”</p>

<p>“Then I am sure all the world must. Dearest
Georgie, how did you get it? I am sure I would
not touch it, only for your sake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I did such a shameful thing. Such a
liberty I never took before! I actually sent the
servant to say, with Mrs. Corklemoreʼs compliments,
that she felt the effect of the fright this
morning, and would like another glass of port, but
would not touch it if any of the gentlemen left the
table even for a moment. And they actually sent
me a dock&ndash;glass, in pleasantry, I suppose: but I
am very glad they did.”</p>

<p>“I will take some, if you take half, dear.”</p>

<p>“Not a drop. My poor weak head is upset in a
moment. But you really need it, dear; and I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
so thoroughly feel for you, because the poor Count,
when my Flore was born, waited on me with such
devotion, day and night, hand and foot.”</p>

<p>“And I am sure Mr. Corklemore must do the
same. No husband could help adoring you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is very good, ‘according to his lights,’
as they say. But I have known him let me cough
three times without getting up for the jujubes.
And once&mdash;but perhaps I ought not to tell you: it
was so very bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you may safely tell me, dear. I will never
repeat it to any one.”</p>

<p>“He actually allowed me to sneeze in the carriage
without saying that I must have a new fur
cloak, or even asking if I had a cold.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, is that all? I may sneeze six times
in an hour, and my husband take no notice, but
run out and leave the front door open, and prune
his horrid little trees. And then he shouts for his
patent top&ndash;dressing. He thinks far more of dressing
them than he does of dressing me.”</p>

<p>“And donʼt you know the reason? Donʼt cry,
sweet child; donʼt cry. I have had so much experience.
I understand men so thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know the reason. I am cross to him
sometimes. And of course I canʼt expect a man
with a mind like his&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You may expect any man to be as wise as
Solomon, if you only know how to manage him. It
is part of the law of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then I am sure I donʼt know what that means:
except that people must get married, and ought to
love one another.”</p>

<p>“The law of nature is this. Between a wife
and a husband there never must be a secret, except
when the lady keeps one. Now, your husband
is, to some extent, a rather superior man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, to the very greatest extent. No one
of any perception can help perceiving that.”</p>

<p>“Then he is quite sure to attempt it; to reserve
himself, upon <i>some</i> point, in an unsympathetic
attitude. This is just what you must not allow.
You have no idea how it grows upon them, and
how soon it supplants affection, and makes a married
man a bachelor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how dreadful! But I really do think,
dear, that you must be wrong this once. My husband
has never kept anything from me; anything,
I mean, which I ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Then he told you about that poor wild Polly?
How very good and kind of him!”</p>

<p>“Polly! What Polly? You donʼt mean to
say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, dear, nothing of that sort! Only the
mare running away with him at night through the
thickest part of the forest.”</p>

<p>“My Polly that eats from my hand! Run away
with Rufus!”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Polly. A perfect miracle that both
of them were not killed. But, of course, he must
have told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Then, after sundry ejaculations, Rosa learned all
about that matter, and was shocked first, and then
thankful, and then hurt.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Mrs. Corklemore, when the
sense of wrong was paramount, “he has some
secret, I am almost sure, about our sad affair at
Nowelhurst. And I am sure, even if you were
not his wife, dear, he need not conceal any matter
of that sort from the daughter of Sir Cradock
Nowellʼs old friend, Mr. Ralph Mohorn.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you another thing,” answered Rosa,
shaking all her pillows with the vehemence of her
emotions, “whether he ought or not, he shall not
do it, Georgie, darling. As sure as I am his
lawful wife I will know every word of it before I
sleep one wink. If not, he must take the consequences
upon both his wife and child.”</p>

<p>“Darling, I think you are quite right. Only
donʼt tell me a word of it. It is such a dreadful
matter, it would make me so unhappy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will tell you every single word, just to prove
to you, Georgie, that I have found the whole of
it out.”</p>

<p>After this laudable resolution, Rosa may be left
to have it out with Rufus. It requires greater skill
than ours to interfere between man and wife, even
without the <i>tertium quid</i> of an astounding baby.</p>

<p class="p1">The ides of March were come and gone, the
balance of day and night was struck; and Sleep,
the queen of half the world, had wheeled across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the equator her poppy&ndash;chintzed throne, or had got
the stars to do it for her, because she was too lazy.
Ha, that sentence is almost worthy of a great
stump&ndash;orator. All I mean to say is, that All Foolsʼ
Day was over. Blessed are the All Fools who
begin the summer (which accounts for its being a
mull with us); and blessed be the All Saints
who begin the winter, and then hand it over to
Beelzebub.</p>

<p>“In April she tunes her bill.” Several nightingales
were at it, for the spring was early, and right
early were many nests conned, planned, and contracted
for. Blessed birds, that never say, “What
are your expectations, sir?” or “How much will
you give your daughter?”&mdash;but feather their nests
without waiting for an appointment in the Treasury.
Nest&ndash;eggs, too, almost as sweet as those of
addled patronage, were beginning to accumulate;
and it took up half a birdʼs time to settle seniority
and precedence among them, fettle them all with
their heads the right way, and throw overboard
the cracked ones. Perhaps, in this last particular,
they exercised a discretion, not only unknown to,
but undreamed of, by any British Government.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark by this time, and two
nightingales, across the valley, strove in Amoibæan
song till the crinkles of the opening leaves fluttered
with soft melody.</p>

<p class="ppq2 p1">“In poplar shadows Philomel complaineth of her brood,<br />
Her callow nestlings plunderʼd from her by the ploughman rude:<br />
From lonely branch all night she pours her weeping musicʼs flow,<br />
Repeats her tale, and fills the world with melody and woe.”</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Georg.</i> iv. 511.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Garnet heeded neither crisp young leaf nor
bulbul; neither did his horse appear to be a judge
of music. Man and horse were drooping, flagging,
jaded and bespent; wanting only the two things
which, according to some philosophers, are all that
men want here below&mdash;a little food, and a deal of
sleep.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet was on his return from Winchester,
whither he now went every week, for some reason
known only to himself, or at least unknown to his
family. It is a long and hilly ride from the west
of Ytene to Winton, and to travel that distance
twice in a day takes the gaiety out of a horse, and
the salience out of a man. No wonder then that
Mr. Garnet slouched his heavy shoulders, and let
his great head droop; for at five&ndash;and&ndash;forty a
powerful man jades sooner than does a slight one.</p>

<p>Presently he began to drowse; for the stout
grey gelding knew every step of the road, and
would take uncommonly good care to avoid all
circumambience: and of late the rider had never
slept, only dozed, and dreamed, and started. Then
he muttered to himself, as he often did in sleep,
but never at home, until he had seen to the fastening
of the door.</p>

<p>“Tried it again&mdash;tried very hard and failed.
Thought of Bob, at last moment. Bob to stand,
and see me hang&mdash;and hate me, and go to the
devil. No, I donʼt think he would hate me, though;
he would say, ‘Father could not help it.’ And
how nice that would be for me, to see Bob take
my part. To see him with his turn&ndash;down collars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
standing proudly up, and saying, ‘Father was a bad
man&mdash;according to your ideas&mdash;I am not going to
dispute them&mdash;but for all that I love him, and so
my children shall.’ If I could be sure that Bob
would only think so, only make his mind up, his
mind up, his mind up&mdash;for there is nothing like it&mdash;whoa,
Grayling, what be looking at?&mdash;and take
poor little Pearl with him, I would go to&ndash;morrow
morning, and do it over at Lymington.”</p>

<p>“Best do it to&ndash;night, govʼnor. No time like the
praysent, and us knows arl about it.”</p>

<p>A tall man had leaped from behind a tree, and
seized Bull Garnetʼs bridle. The grey gelding
reared and struck him; but he kept his hold, till
the muzzle of a large revolver felt cold against
his ear. Then Issachar Jupp fell back; he knew
the man he had to deal with, how stern in his fury,
how reckless, despite the better part of him. And
Issachar was not prepared to leave his Loo an
orphan.</p>

<p>“No man robs me,” cried Mr. Garnet, in his
most tremendous voice, “except at the cost of my
life, and the risk of his. I have seven and sixpence
about me; I will give it up to no man.
Neither will I shoot any man, unless he tries to
get it.”</p>

<p>“Nubbody wants to rob you, govʼnor, only to
have a little rattysination with you. Possible you
know me now?”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet fell back in his saddle. He would
rather have met a dozen robbers. By the voice he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
recognised a man whom he had once well known,
and had good cause to know;&mdash;through his outrage
upon whom, he had left the northern counties;
the man whom he had stricken headlong down a
coal&ndash;shaft, as the leader of rebellion, the night after
Pearl was christened, nigh twenty years ago.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you; Jupp your name is. Small
credit it is to know you.”</p>

<p>“And smarler still to know you, Bull Garnet.
Try your pistol thing, if you like. You must have
rare stommick, I should think, to be up for another
murder.”</p>

<p>“Issachar, I am sorry for you. Do you call it
a murder to keep such a fellow as you off?”</p>

<p>“No, I dunna carl that a murder, because I be
arl alive. But I do carl a murder what you did to
young Clayton Nowell.”</p>

<p>“Fool, what do you know of it? Let go my
horse, I say. You know pretty well what <i>I</i> am.”</p>

<p>“I know you haʼnʼt much patience, govʼnor, and
be arlways in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Jupp hesitated, but would not be beaten, whatever
might be the end of it.</p>

<p>“I am in no hurry now, Jupp; I will listen to
all you have to say. But not with your hand on
my bridle.”</p>

<p>“There goeth free then. Arl knows you be no
liar.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you remember that, Issachar. Hold
the horse, while I get off. Now throw the bridle
over that branch, and I will sit down here. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
here into the moonlight, man; and look me in the
face. Here is the pistol for you, if you bear me
any revenge.”</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what he did, because he had
no time to think, Jupp obeyed Bull Garnetʼs orders
even to the last&mdash;for he took the pistol in his hand,
and tried to look straight at his adversary; but his
eyes would not co&ndash;operate. Then he laid the pistol
on the bank; but so that he could reach it.</p>

<p>“Issachar Jupp,” said Mr. Garnet, looking at
him steadily, and speaking very quietly; “have
you any children?”</p>

<p>“Only one&mdash;a leetle gal, but an oncommon
good un.”</p>

<p>“How old is she?”</p>

<p>“Five year old, plase God, come next Valentineʼs
Day.”</p>

<p>“Now, when she grows up, and is pure and
good, would you like to have her heart broken?”</p>

<p>“Iʼd break any coveʼs head as doed it.”</p>

<p>“But supposing she were betrayed and ruined,
made a plaything, and then thrown away&mdash;what
would you do then?”</p>

<p>“God Almighty knows, man. I canʼt abide to
think of it.”</p>

<p>“And if the&mdash;the man who did it, was the
grandson of the man who had ruined your own
mother, lied before God in the church to her, and
then left her to go to the workhouse, with you
his outcast bastard&mdash;while he rolled in gold, and
laughed at her&mdash;what would you do then, Jupp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“By the God that made me, Iʼd have my revenge,
if I went to hell for it.”</p>

<p>“I have said enough. Do exactly as you please.
Me you cannot help or harm. Death is all I long
for&mdash;only for my children.”</p>

<p>Still he looked at Issachar, but now without a
thought of him; only as a man looks out upon the
sea or sky, expecting no return. And Issachar
Jupp, so dense and pig&ndash;headed&mdash;surly and burly,
and weasel&ndash;eyed&mdash;in a word, retrospectively British&mdash;gazing
at Bull Garnet then, got some inkling of
an anguish such as he who lives to feel&mdash;far better
were it for that man that he had never been
born.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="p2">To bar the entail of crime. A bitter and abortive
task; at least, in this vindictive world, where
Christians dwell more on Mount Sinai than on the
mount that did not quake and burn with fire.</p>

<p>And yet for this, and little else, still clung to
fair fame and life the man who rather would have
lain beneath the quick&ndash;lime of Newgate. It was
not for the empty part, the reputation, the position,
the respect of those who prove the etymon of
the word by truly looking backward&mdash;not for these
alone, nor mainly, did Bull Garnet bear the anguish
now from month to month more bitter, deeper, less
concealable. He strove with himself, and checked
himself, and bit his tongue, and jerked back
his heart, and nursed that shattered lie, his
life, if so might be that Pearl and Bob should
start anew in another land, with a fair career
before them. Not that he cared, more than he
could help, whether they might be rich or poor;
only that he would like them to have the chance of
choosing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>This chance had not been fair for him, forsaken
as he was, and outcast; banned by all the laws of
men, because his mother had been trustful, and his
father treacherous. Yet against all chances, he,
by his own rightful power, deeply hating and
(which was worse) conscientiously despising every
social prejudice, made his way among smaller men,
taught himself by day and night, formed his own
strong character, with the hatred of tyranny for its
base, and tyranny of his own for its apex; and finally
gained success in the world, and large views of
Christianity. And in all of this he was sincere!</p>

<p>It was a vile and bitter wrong to which he owed
his birth. Sir Cradock Nowell, the father of the
present baronet, had fallen in love of some sort
with a comely Yorkshire maiden, whose motherʼs
farm adjoined the moors, whereon the shooting
quarters were. Then, in that period of mean
license, when fashionable servility was wriggling,
like a cellar&ndash;slug, in the slime&ndash;track of low princes,
Sir Cradock Nowell did what few of his roystering
friends would have thought of&mdash;unfashionable
Tarquinian, he committed a quiet bigamy. He
had lived apart from Lady Nowell, even before
her second confinement; because he could not get
on with her. So Miss Garnet went with him to
the quiet altar of a little Yorkshire church, and
fancied she was Lady Nowell; only that must be
a secret, “because they had not the kingʼs consent,
for he was not in a state to give it.”</p>

<p>When she learned her niddering wrong, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
despite to her unborn child, she cast her curse upon
the race, not with loud rant, but long scorn, and
went from her widowed mother, to a cold and unknown
place.</p>

<p>So soon as Bull Garnet was old enough to know
right from wrong, and to see how much more of
the latter had fallen to his share, two courses lay
before him. Two, I mean, were possible to a strong
and upright nature; to a false and weak one fifty
would have offered, and a little of each been taken.
Conscious as he was of spirit, energy, and decision,
he might apply them all to very ungenial purposes,
to sarcasm, contemptuousness, and general misanthropy.
Or else he might take a larger view, pity
the poor old&ndash;fashioned prigs who despise a man for
his fatherʼs fault, and generously adapt himself to
the broadest Christianity.</p>

<p>The latter course was the one he chose; in solid
earnest, too, because it suited his nature. And so
perhaps we had better say that he chose no course
at all, but had the wiser one forced upon him.
Yet the old Adam of damnable temper too often
would rush out of Paradise, and prove in strong
language that he would not be put off together
with his works. Exeter Hall would have owned
him, in spite of all his backslidings, as a very “far&ndash;advanced
Christian;” because he was so “evangelical.”
And yet he never dealt in cant, nor distributed
idyllic tracts, Sabbatarian pastorals, where
godly Thomas meets drunken John, and converts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
him to the diluted <i>vappa</i> of an unfermented Sunday.</p>

<p>And now this man, whom all who knew him
either loved or hated, felt the troubles closing
around him, and saw that the end was coming.
He had kept his own sense of justice down, while
it jerked (like a thistle on springs) in his heart; he
had worn himself out with thinking for ever what
would become of his children, whom he had wronged
more heavily than his own bad father had wronged
him&mdash;only the difference was that he loved them;
and most of all he had let a poor fellow, whom he
liked and esteemed most truly, bear all the brunt,
all the misery, all the despair of fratricide.</p>

<p>Now all he asked for, all he prayed for&mdash;and, indeed,
he prayed more than ever now, and with
deeper feeling; though many would have feared
to do it&mdash;now his utmost hope was to win six
months of life. In that time all might be arranged
for his childrenʼs interest; his purchase of those
five hundred acres from the Crown Commissioners&mdash;all
good land, near the Romsey&ndash;road, but too
full of juice&mdash;would soon be so completed that he
could sell again at treble the price he gave, so well
had he reclaimed the land, while equitably his;
and then Bob should have half, and Pearl take
half (because she had been so injured), and, starting
with the proceeds of all his earthly substance
before it should escheat, be happy in America, and
think fondly of dead father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>This was all he lived for now. It may seem a
wild programme; but, practical as he was in business,
and not to be wronged of a halfpenny, Bull
Garnet was vague and sentimental when he “took
on” about his children. Furious if they were
wronged, loving them as the cow did (who, without
a horn to her head, pounded dead the leopard),
ready to take most liberal views of everything
beyond them, yet keeping ever to his eyes that
parental lens, whose focus is so very short, and
therefore, by the optic laws, its magnifying power
and aberration glorious.</p>

<p>Now three foes were closing round him; all of
whom, by different process, and from different
premises, had arrived at the one conclusion. The
three were, as he knew too well, Rufus Hutton,
Issachar Jupp, and Mr. Chope, of Southampton.
Of the first he held undue contempt (not knowing
all his evidence); the second he had for the time
disarmed, by an appeal <i>ad hominem</i>; the third was
the most to be feared, the most awful, because so
crafty, keen, and deep, so utterly impenetrable.</p>

<p>Mr. Chope, the partner and “brains” of Cole,
the coroner, was absent upon a lawyerʼs holiday at
the time of the inquest. When he came home,
and heard all about it, and saw the place, and put
questions, he scarcely knew what to think. Only
upon one point he was certain&mdash;the verdict had
been wrong. Either Cradock Nowell had shot
his brother purposely, or some one else had done
so. To Chopeʼs clear intuition, and thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
knowledge of fire&ndash;arms&mdash;for his one relaxation was
shooting&mdash;it was plain as possible that there had
been no accident. To the people who told him
about the cartridge “balling,” he expressed no
opinion; but to himself he said, “Pooh! I have
seen Cradock Nowell shoot. He always knew all
he was doing. He never would put a <i>green</i> cartridge
into his gun for a woodcock. And the
others very seldom ball. And even if he had a
green cartridge, look at the chances against it. I
would lay my life Clayton Nowell was shot on
purpose.”</p>

<p>Then, of course, Mr. Chope set to, not only with
hope of reward, but to gratify his own instinct, at
the puzzle and wards of the question. If he had
known the neighbourhood well, and all the local
politics, he must have arrived at due conclusion
long before he did. But a heavy piece of conveyancing
came into the office of Cole, Chope, and
Co., and, being far more lucrative than amateur
speculations, robbed them of their attention. But
now that stubborn piece was done with, and Mr.
Chope again at leisure to pursue his quest. Twice
or thrice every week he was seen, walking in his
deliberate way, as if every step were paid for,
through the village of Nowelhurst, and among the
haunts of the woodcutters. He carried his great
head downwards, as a bloodhound on the track
does, but raised it, and met with a soft sweet
smile all who cared to look at him. In his hand
he bore a fishing&ndash;rod, and round his hat some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
trout&ndash;flies; and often he entered the village inn,
and had bread and cheese in the taproom, though
invited into the parlour. Although his boots were
soaked and soiled as if he had been wading, and
the landing&ndash;net, slung across his back, had evidently
been dripping, he opened to none his fishing
creel, neither had any trout fried, but spoke in a
desponding manner of the shyness of the fish, and
the brightness of the water, and vowed every time
that his patience was now at last exhausted. As
none could fish in that neighbourhood without asking
Sir Cradockʼs permission, or trespassing against
him, and as the old baronet was most duly tenacious
of all his sporting rights, everybody wondered
what Mark Stote was about to allow a mere
far&ndash;comer to carry on so in Nowelhurst water. But
Mark Stote knew a great deal better what was up
than they did.</p>

<p>Four or five times now, Bull Garnet, riding on
his rounds of business, had met Simon Chope, and
bowed politely to him. On the first occasion, Mr.
Chope, knowing very little of Garnet, and failing
to comprehend him (as we fail, at first sight, with
all antipodes), lost his slow sequacious art, because
he over&ndash;riddled it. All very cunning men do this;
even my Lord Bacon, but never our brother
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>But Mr. Garnet read him truly, and his purpose
also, by the aid of his own consciousness; and a
thrill of deep, cold fear went through that hot and
stormy heart. Nevertheless, he met the case in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
usual manner, and puzzled Mr. Chope on the third
or fourth encounter by inviting him to dinner.
The lawyer found some ready plea for declining
this invitation; sleuth and cold&ndash;blooded as he was,
he could not accept hospitality to sift his host for
murder. Of course Mr. Garnet had foreseen the
refusal of this overture; but it added to his general
alarm, even more than it contributed to his momentary
relief. Clearly enough he knew, or felt,
that now he was running a race against time; and
if he could only win that race, and give the prize
to his children, how happily would he yield himself
to his only comfort&mdash;death. With his strong religious
views&mdash;right or wrong, who shall dare to
say? for the matter is not of reason&mdash;he doubted
Godʼs great mercy to him in another world no
more than he doubted his own great love to his own
begotten.</p>

<p>And sad it was, enough to move the tears of
any Stoic, to behold Bull Garnet now sitting with
his children. Instead of being shy and distant
(as for a while he had been, when the crime was
new upon him) he would watch them, word by
word, smile by smile, or tear for tear, as if he
never could have enough of the little that was left
to him. They had begun to talk again carelessly
in his presence, as the manner of the young is.
Bob had found that the vague, dark cloud, of
whose origin he knew nothing, was lifted a little,
and lightened; and Pearl, who knew all about it,
was trying to slip from beneath its shadow, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the self&ndash;preservation of youth, and into the long&ndash;obscured
but native sunlight of a daughterʼs love.
And all the while their father, the man of force
and violence, would look from one to the other of
them, perceiving, with a curious smile, little traits
of himself; often amused at, and blessing them
for, their very sage inexperience; thinking to show
how both were wrong, yet longing not to do it.
And then he would begin to wonder which of them
he loved more deeply. Pearl had gained upon him
so, by the patience of her wrong, by coming to the
hearth for shelter from the storms of outer love.</p>

<p>In all races against time, luck, itself the child of
time, is apt to govern the result more than highest
skill may. So far, most of the luck had been in
Mr. Garnetʼs favour; the approach of unlucky
Cradock that day, the distraction of his mind&mdash;the
hurried and jostled aim which even misled himself;
the distance of John Rosedew; the blundering
and timid coroner and the soft&ndash;hearted jury; even
the state of the weather; and since that time the
perversion and weakness of the fatherʼs mind: all
these had prevented that close inquiry which must
have led to either his conviction or confession. For,
of course, he would have confessed at once, come
what might, if an innocent man had been apprehended
for his guilt.</p>

<p>Only in one important matter&mdash;so far at least as
he knew yet, not having heard of Jemʼs discovery,
and Mr. Huttonʼs advance upon it&mdash;had fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
been against him; that one was the crashing of his
locked cupboard, and the exposure of the broken
gun&ndash;case to Rufus Huttonʼs eyes. And now it
was an adverse fate which brought Mr. Chope
upon the stage, and yet it was a kindly one which
kept him apart from Hutton. For Simon Chope
and Rufus Hutton disliked one another heartily;
as the old repulsion is between cold blood and hot
blood.</p>

<p>As it happened, Mr. Chope was Mrs. Corklemoreʼs
pet lawyer: he had been employed to see
that she was defrauded of no adequate rights
uxorial upon her second marriage. And uncommonly
good care he took to secure the lionʼs share
for her. Indeed, had it been possible for him to
fall in love at all with anything but money, that
foolish lapse would have been his, at the very first
sight of Georgie. Sweetly innocent and good, she
did so sympathize with “to wit, whereas, and notwithstanding;”
she entered with such gush of
heart into the bitter necessity of making many
folios, and charging for every one of them, which
the depravity of human nature has forced on a class
whose native bias rather tends to poetry; she felt
so acutely (when all was made plain to her, and
Mr. Corklemore paid the bill) how very very wrong
it was not to have implicit confidence&mdash;”in being
cheated,” under her breath, and that shaft was
Cupidʼs to Mr. Chope&mdash;in a word, he was so
smitten, that he doubled all his charges, and inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
an especial power of appointment, for (Mr.
Corklemore having the gout) he looked on her as
his reversion.</p>

<p>“Hang it,” he said, for his extreme idea of final
punishment was legal; “hang it, if I married that
woman, our son would be Lord Chancellor. I
never saw such a liar.”</p>

<p>Now it was almost certain that, under Sir Cradock
Nowellʼs settlement upon marriage, an entail
had been created. The lawyers, who do as they
like in such matters, and live in a cloud of their
own breath, are sure to provide for continuance,
and the bills of their grandchildren.</p>

<p>“Alas, how sad!” thought Georgie, as she lay
back in the Nowelhurst carriage on her way to
Cole, Chope, and Co.; “how very sad if it should
be so. Then there will be no cure for it, but to
get up the evidence, meet the dreadful publicity,
and get the poor fellow convicted. And they say
he is so good&ndash;looking! Perhaps I hate ugly people
so much, because I am so pretty. Oh, how I wish
Mr. Corklemore walked a little more like a gentleman.
But as a sacred duty to my innocent
darling, I must leave no stone unturned.”</p>

<p>Fully convinced of her pure integrity, Georgie
drove up in state and style to the office of Cole,
Chope, and Co., somewhere in Southampton. She
would make no secret of it, but go in Sir Cradock
Nowellʼs carriage, and then evil&ndash;minded persons
could not misinterpret her. Mr. Chope alone could
tell her, as she had said to “Uncle Cradock” (with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a faint hope that he might let slip something), what
really was the nature and effect of her own marriage&ndash;settlement.
Things of that sort were so far
beyond her, so distasteful to her; sufficient for the
day was the evil thereof; she could sympathize
with almost any one, but really not with a person
who looked forward to any disposal of property,
unless it became, for the sake of the little ones, a
matter of strict duty; and even then it must cause
a heart&ndash;pang&mdash;oh, such a bitter heart&ndash;pang!</p>

<p>“Coleʼs brains” was not the man to make himself
too common. He always required digging out,
like a fossil, from three or four mural <i>septa</i>. Being
disinterred at last from the innermost room, after
winks, and nods, and quiet knocks innumerable, he
came out with both hands over his eyes, because
the light was too much for him, he had been so
hard at work.</p>

<p>And the first thing he always expressed was surprise,
even though he had made the appointment.
Mr. Simon Chope, attorney and solicitor, was now
about five&ndash;and&ndash;thirty years old, a square&ndash;built man,
just growing stout, with an enormous head, and a
frizzle of hair which made it look still larger.
There was a depth of gravity in his paper&ndash;white
countenance&mdash;slightly marked with small&ndash;pox&mdash;a
power of not laughing, such as we seldom see,
except in a man of great humour, who says odd
things, but rarely smiles till every one else is laughing.
But if Chope were gifted, as he may have
been, with a racy vein of comedy, nobody ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
knew it. He was not accustomed to make a joke
gratis, neither to laugh upon similar terms at the
jokes of other people. Tremendous gravity, quiet
movements, very clear perception, most judicious
reticence&mdash;these had been his characteristics since
he started in life as an office&ndash;boy, and these would
abide with him until he got everything he wanted;
if any man ever does that.</p>

<p>With many a bow and smile, expressing surprise,
delight, and deference, Mr. Chope conducted to a
special room that lady in whom he felt an interest
transcending contingent remainder. Mrs. Corklemore
swam to her place with that ease of movement
which was one of her chief fascinations, and
fixed her large grey eyes on the lawyer with the
sweetest expression of innocence.</p>

<p>“I fear, Mr. Chope&mdash;oh, where is my husband?
he promised to meet me here&mdash;I fear that I must
give you, oh, so much trouble again. But you
exerted yourself so very kindly on my behalf about
eighteen months ago, that I cannot bear to consult
any other gentleman, even in the smallest matter.”</p>

<p>“My services, such as they are, shall ever be at
the entire disposal of Madame la Comtesse.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chope would always address her so; “a
countess once, a countess for ever,” was his view of
the subject. Moreover, it ignored Mr. Corklemore,
whom he hated as his supplanter; and, best reason
of all, the lady evidently liked it.</p>

<p>“You are so very kind, I felt sure that you
would say so. But in this case, the business is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
rather Mr. Corklemoreʼs than my own. But he
has left it entirely to me, having greater confidence,
perhaps, in my apprehension.”</p>

<p>She knew, of course, that so to disparage her
husband, by implication, was not in the very best
taste; but she felt that Mr. Chope would be
pleased, as she quite understood his sentiments.</p>

<p>“And not without excellent reason,” answered
the lawyer, softly; “if any lady would be an
ornament to our profession, it is Madame la Comtesse.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Mr. Chope, oh no! I am so very
simple. And I never should have the heart to do
the things you are compelled to do. But to return:
this little matter, in which I hope for your assistance,
is a trifling exchange of mixed land with Sir
Cradock Nowell.”</p>

<p>“Ah, to be sure!” said Chope, feeling slightly
disappointed, for he had some idea that the question
would be more lucrative; “if you will give
me particulars, it shall have our best attention.”</p>

<p>“I think I have heard,” said Georgie, knowing
thoroughly all about it, “that there is some mode
of proceeding, under some Act of Parliament,
which lightens, perhaps, to some extent, the legal
difficulties&mdash;and, oh yes, the expenses.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore knew how Mr. Chope had
drawn her a very long bill&mdash;upon his imagination.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” replied Mr. Chope, smitten
yet more deeply with the legal knowledge, and full
of the future Lord Chancellor; “there is a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and ready way of dealing with almost anything.
What they call a statutory proceeding, shockingly
careless and haphazard, and most ungermainely
thrust into an Enclosure Act. But we never
permit any clients of ours to imperil their interests
so, for the sake, perhaps, of half a sovereign.
There is such a deal of quackery in all those
dabblesome interferences with ancient institutions.
For security, for comfort of mind, for scientific
investigation, there is nothing like the exhaustive
process of a good common law conveyance. Look
at a proper abstract of title! A charming thing
to contemplate; and still more charming, if possible,
the requisitions upon it, when prepared by
eminent counsel. But the tendency of the present
age is to slur and cut short everything.
Melancholy, most melancholy!”</p>

<p>“Especially for the legal gentlemen, I suppose,
Mr. Chope?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It does hurt our feelings so to see all
the grand safeguards, invented by men of consummate
ability, swept away like old rubbish. I even
heard of a case last week, where a piece of land,
sold for 900<i>l</i>., actually cost the purchaser only 50<i>l</i>.
for conveyance!”</p>

<p>“Oh, how disgraceful!” cried Georgie, so nicely,
that Chope detected no irony: “and now, I presume,
if we proceed in the ordinary way, we must
deliver and receive what you call ‘abstracts of
title.’”</p>

<p>“Quite so, quite so, whichever way you proceed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
It is a most indispensable step. It will be my
duty and privilege to deduce Mr. Corklemoreʼs
title; and Mr. Brockwoodʼs, I presume, to show
Sir Cradock Nowellʼs. All may be completed in
six months’ time, if both sides act with energy. If
you will favour me with the description of parcels,
I will write at once to Mr. Brockwood; or, indeed,
I shall see him to&ndash;night. He will be at the Masonsʼ
dinner.”</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Corklemore was taken quite
aback. It is needless to say that no interchange
of land had ever been dreamed of, except by herself,
as a possible method of learning “how the
land lay;” and indeed there was no intermixed
land at all, as Mr. Chope strongly suspected.
Neither was he, for the matter of that, likely to
meet Mr. Brockwood; but when it becomes a
<i>professional</i> question, a man can mostly out&ndash;lie a
woman, because he has more experience.</p>

<p>“Be guided by me, if you please,” said Georgie,
smiling enough to misguide any one; “we must
not be premature, lest we seem too anxious about
the bargain. And, I am sure, we have done our
very best to be perfectly fair with Sir Cradock.
Only we trust you, of course, to be sure that he
has reposing, composing&mdash;oh, how stupid I am! I
mean disposing power; that there is no awkward
entail.”</p>

<p>Here she looked so preternaturally simple, which
she would never have done but for her previous
flutter, that Simon Chope in a moment knew exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
what her game was. Nevertheless, he answered
nicely in that tantalizing way which often
makes a woman flash forth.</p>

<p>“We shall see, no doubt, ere long. Of course
Sir Cradock would not propose it, unless he had
full power. Is it quite certain that poor Clayton
Nowell left no legitimate offspring?”</p>

<p>Oh, what a horrible suggestion! Such a thing
would quite upset every scheme. Georgie had
never thought of it. And yet it might even be
so. There was something in the tone of Mr.
Chopeʼs whisper, which convinced her that he had
heard something.</p>

<p>And only think; young men are so little looked
after at Oxford, that they can get married very
easily, without anything being heard of it. At
least, so thought Mrs. Corklemore. And then oh,
if poor Clayton had left a child, how his grandfather
would idolize him! Sir Cradock would
slip from her hands altogether; and scarcely any
hope would remain of diverting the succession.
Even if the child was a daughter, probably she
would inherit, and could not yet have committed
felony. Oh, what a fearful blow it would be!</p>

<p>All this passed through that rapid mind in about
half a second, during which time, however, the
thinker could not help looking nonplussed. Mr.
Chope of course perceived it, and found himself
more and more wide&ndash;awake.</p>

<p>“Well, what a strange idea!” she exclaimed,
with unfeigned surprise. “There has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the slightest suggestion of anything of the kind.
And indeed I have lately heard what surprised me
very much, that he had formed an&mdash;an improper
attachment in a quarter very near home.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Do you know to whom?” It was
Mr. Chope who was trying now to appear indifferent.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was told. But it does not become me
to repeat such stories.”</p>

<p>“It not only becomes you in this case, but it is
your absolute duty, and&mdash;and your true interest.”</p>

<p>“Why, you quite frighten me, Mr. Chope.
Your manner is so strange.”</p>

<p>“It would grieve me deeply indeed to alarm
Madame la Comtesse,” answered the lawyer, trying
in vain to resume his airiness; “but I cannot do
justice to any one who does not fully confide in
me. In a case like this, especially, such interests
are concerned, the title is so&mdash;so complicated, that
purely as a matter of business we must be advised
about everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I see no reason why I should not tell
you. It cannot be of any importance. Poor
Clayton Nowell had fallen in love with a girl very
far beneath him&mdash;the daughter, I think she was, of
a Mr. Garnet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I had heard a report of that
sort”&mdash;he had never heard, but suspected it&mdash;”it
can, of course, signify nothing, if the matter went
no further; nevertheless, I thank you for your
gratifying confidence. I apologize if I alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
you; there is nothing alarming at all in it. I was
thinking of something very different.” This was
utterly false; but it diverted her from the subject.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see. Of something, you mean,
which might have caused a disagreement between
the unfortunate brothers. Now tell me your
opinion&mdash;in the strictest confidence, of course&mdash;as
to that awful occurrence. Do you think&mdash;oh, I
hope not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was far away at the time, and can form no
conclusion. But I know that my partner, Mr.
Cole, the coroner, was too sadly convinced,&mdash;oh, I
beg your pardon, I forgot for the moment that
Madame la Comtesse&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pray forget my relationship, or rather consider
it as a reason; oh, I would rather know the sad,
sad truth. It is the suspense, oh the cruel suspense.
What was Mr. Coleʼs conclusion?”</p>

<p>“That if Cradock Nowell were put on his trial,
he would not find a jury in England but must
convict him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how inexpressibly shocking! Excuse me,
may I ask for a glass of water? Oh, thank you,
thank you. No wine, if you please. I must hurry
away quite rudely. The fresh air will revive me.
I cannot conclude my instructions to&ndash;day. How
could I think of such little matters? Please to do
nothing until you hear from me. Yes, I hear the
carriage. I told Giles to allow me ten minutes
only, unless Mr. Corklemore came. You see how
thoroughly well I know the value of your time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
We feel it so acutely; but I must not presume; no
further, if you please!”</p>

<p>Having thus appraised Mr. Chope, and apprised
him of his distance, from a social point of view,
Georgie gave him a smile which disarmed him, at
least for the moment. But he was not the lawyer,
or the man, to concede her the last word.</p>

<p>“We lawyers never presume, madam, any
more than we assume. We must have everything
proved.”</p>

<p>“Except your particulars of account, which you
leave to prove themselves.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! You are too clever for the whole
profession. We can only prove our inferiority.”</p>

<p>He stood, with his great bushy head uncovered,
looking after the grand apparatus, and three boys
sitting behind it; and then he went sadly back,
and said, “Our son might have been Lord Chancellor.
But I beat her this time in lying.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="p2">Two months of opening spring are past, and the
forest is awaking. Up, all we who love such
things; come and see more glorious doings than of
man or angel. However hearts have been winter&ndash;bound
with the nip of avarice, and the iron frost of
selfishness, however minds have checked their sap
in narrowness of ideal, let us all burst bands awhile
before the bright sun, as leaves do. Heavenʼs
young breath is stirring through crinkled bud and
mossy crevice, peaceful spears of pensioned reeds,
and flags all innocent of battle. Lo, where the wind
goes, while we look, playing with and defying us,
chasing the dip of a primrose&ndash;bank, and touching
sweet lips with dalliance. Lifting first the shining
tutsan, gently so, and apologizing, then after a
tender whisper to the nodding milkwort, away to
where the soft blue eyes of the periwinkle hesitate.
Last, before he dies away, the sauntering ruffler
looks and steps into a quiet tufted nook, overhung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with bank, and lintelled with the twisted oak&ndash;roots.
Here, as in a niche of Sabbath, dwells the nervous
soft wood&ndash;sorrel, feeding upon leaf&ndash;mould, quivering
with its long&ndash;stalked cloves, pale of hue, and
shunning touch, delicate wood&ndash;sorrel, coral&ndash;rooted,
shamrock&ndash;leafed, loved and understood of few, except
good Fra Angelico.</p>

<p>Tut&mdash;we want stronger life than that; and here
we have it overhead, with many a galling boss
and buff, yet, on the whole, worth treeʼs exertion,
and worth manʼs inspection. See the oak&ndash;leaves
bursting out, crimped and crannied at their birth,
with little nicks and serrate jags like “painted
lady” chrysalids, or cowries pushing their tongues
out, throwing off the hidesome tuck, and frilled
with pellucid copper. See, as well, the fluted
beech&ndash;leaves, started a full moon ago, offering out
of fawn&ndash;skin gloves, and glossed with waterproof
copal. Then the ash&mdash;but hold, I know not how
the ash comes out, because it gives so little
warning; or rather, it warns a long, long time,
and then does it all of a sudden. Tush&mdash;what
man cares now to glance at the yearly manuscript
of God? Let the leaves go; they are not <i>inscripti
nomina regum</i>.</p>

<p>Yet the brook&mdash;though time flees faster, who
can grudge one glance at brooklet? Where the
mock&ndash;myrtle begins to dip, where the young agrimony
comes up, and the early forget&ndash;me&ndash;not pushes
its claim upon our remembrance, and the water&ndash;lily
floats half&ndash;way up, quivering dusk in the clearness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
like a trout upon the hover. Look how the little
waves dance towards us, glancing and casting over,
drawing a tongue with limpid creases from the
broad pool above, then funnelling into a narrow
neck over a shelf of gravel, and bubbling and babbling
with petulant freaks into corners of calmer
reflection. There an old tree leans solemnly over,
with brows bent, and arms folded, turning the
course of the brook with his feet, and shedding a
crystal darkness.</p>

<p>Below this, the yellow banks break away into a
scoop on either side, where a green lane of the
forest comes down and wades into the water. Here
is a favourite crossing&ndash;place for the cattle of the
woodland, and a favourite bower for cows to rest
in, and chew the cud of soft contemplation. And
here is a grey wooden bridge for the footpath,
adding to rather than destroying the solitude of
the scene, because it is plain that a pair of feet
once in a week would astonish it. Yet in the
depth of loneliness, and the quiet repose of shadow,
all is hope, and reassurance, sense of thanks, and
breath of praise. For is not the winter gone by,
and forgotten, the fury and darkness and terror,
the inclination of March to rave, and the April too
given to weeping? Surely the time of sweet
flowers is come, and the glory of summer approaching,
the freedom of revelling in the sun, the vesture
of the magnificent trees, and the singing of birds
among them.</p>

<p>Through the great Huntley Wood, and along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the banks of the Millaford brook, this fine morning
of the May, wander our Rosalind and Celia, Amy
to wit, and Eoa. It is a long way from Nowelhurst,
but they have brought their lunch, and mean
to make a day of it in the forest, seeking balm for
wounded hearts in good green leaf and buoyant
air. Coming to the old plank&ndash;bridge, they sit
upon a bank to watch the rising of the trout, for
the stone&ndash;fly is on the water. Eoa has a great idea
that she could catch a trout with a kidney&ndash;bean
stick and a fly; but now she has not the heart for
it; and Amy says it would be so cruel, and they
are so pretty.</p>

<p>“What a lovely place!” says Amy; “I could
sit here all day long. How that crab&ndash;apple, clothed
with scarlet, seems to rouge the water!”</p>

<p>“It isnʼt scarlet, I tell you, Amy, any more than
you are. Itʼs only a deep, deep pink. You never
can tell colours.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. It is very pretty. And so
are you when you are good and not contradictory&mdash;ʼcontradictionary,’
as James Pottles calls
Coræbus.”</p>

<p>“Well, it does just as well. Whatʼs the good of
being so particular? I am sure I am none the
better for it; and I have not jumped the brook
ever so long, and have thrown away my gaiters
just because Uncle John said&mdash;oh, you are all
alike in England.”</p>

<p>“What did my father say, if you please, that
possessed such odious sameness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“There, there, I am so glad to see you in a
passion, dear; because I thought you never could
be. Uncle John only said that no doubt somebody
would like me better, if I gave up all that, and
stayed in&ndash;doors all day. And I have been trying
hard to do it; but he is worse than he was before.
I sat on a bench in the chase last Monday, and he
went by and never noticed me, though I made
quite a noise with my hat on the wood until I was
nearly ashamed of myself. But I need not have
been alarmed, for my lord went by without even
looking.”</p>

<p>“And what do you mean to do about it?”
Amy took the deepest interest in Eoaʼs love&ndash;affair.</p>

<p>“Oh, you need not smile, Amy. It is all very
well for you, I dare say; but it makes me dreadfully
angry. Just as if I were nobody! And
after I have told Uncle Cradock of my intentions
to settle.”</p>

<p>“You premature little creature! But my father
was quite right in his advice, as he always is; and
not for that reason only. You belong to a well&ndash;known
family, and, for their sake as well as your
own, you are bound to be very nice, dear, and to do
only what is nice, instead of making a tomboy of
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Tomboy, indeed! And nice! Nice things
they did, didnʼt they&mdash;shooting one another?”</p>

<p>Almost before she had uttered the words, she
was thoroughly ashamed of herself, for she knew
about Amy and Cradock from the maidenʼs own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
confession. Amy arose without reply, and, taking
her little basket, turned into the homeward path,
with a little quiet sigh. Eoa thought for a
moment, and then, having conquered herself,
darted after the outraged friend.</p>

<p>“I wish to have no more to do with you. That
is all,” cried Amy, with Eoaʼs strong arms round
her waist.</p>

<p>“But, indeed, you shall. You know what a
brute I am. I canʼt help it; but I will try. I
will bite my tongue off to be forgiven.”</p>

<p>“I simply wish, Miss Nowell, to have nothing
more to do with you.”</p>

<p>“Then you are a great deal worse than I am;
because you are unforgiving. I thought you were
so wonderfully good; and now I am sorry for you,
even more than for myself. I had better go back
to the devilʼs people, if this is the way of Christians.”</p>

<p>“Could you forgive any one in a moment who
had wounded you most savagely?”</p>

<p>“In a moment,&mdash;if they were sorry, and asked
me.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Sure, indeed! How could I help it?”</p>

<p>“Then, Eoa, you cannot help being more like
a Christian than I am. I am very persistent, and
steadily bitter to any one who wrongs me. You
are far better than I am, Eoa; because you cannot
hate any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I donʼt know about being better, Amy; I only
know that I donʼt hate any one&mdash;with all my heart
I mean&mdash;except Mrs. Nowell Corklemore.”</p>

<p>Here Amy could not help laughing at Eoaʼs
method of proving her rule; and the other took
advantage of it to make her sit down, and kiss her,
and beg her pardon a dozen times, because she was
such a little savage; and then to open her own
lunch&ndash;basket, and spread a white cloth, and cover
it with slices of rusk and reindeerʼs tongue, and
hearted lettuce, and lemonade, and a wing of cold
duck at the corner.</p>

<p>“I left it to Hoggy,” she cried in triumph, “and
he has deserved my confidence. Beat that if you
can now, my darling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can beat that out and out,” said Amy,
who still was crying, just a drop now and then,
because her emotions were “persistent:” then she
smiled, because she knew so well no old butler could
touch her in catering; but I must not tell what
Amy had, for fear of making people hungry.
Only in justice it should be said that neither
basket went home full; for both the young ladies
were “hearty;” and they kissed one another in
spite of the stuffing.</p>

<p>“Oh, Amy, I do love you so, whenever you
donʼt scold me. I am sure I was meant for a
Christian. Hereʼs that nasty sneakʼs lawn handkerchief.
I picked her pocket this morning. I
do twice a week for practice. But I wonʼt wipe
your pretty eyes with it, darling, because I do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
loathe her. Now, if you please, no more crying,
Amy. What a queer thing you are!”</p>

<p>“Most truly may I return the compliment,”
answered Amy, smiling through the sparkle of
her tears. “But you donʼt mean to say that you
keep what you steal?”</p>

<p>“Oh no; it is not worth it. And I hate her
too much to keep anything. Last week I lit the
fire in my dressing&ndash;room, on purpose to burn her
purse. You should have seen the money melting.
I took good care, of course, not to leave it in the
ashes, though. I am forming quite a collection of
it; for I donʼt mind keeping it at all, when it has
been through the fire. And you canʼt think how
pretty it is, all strings and dots of white and
yellow.”</p>

<p>“Well! I never heard such a thing. Why, you
might be transported, Eoa!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, if they found me out; but they
are much too stupid for that. Besides, it is such
fun; the only fun I have now, since I left off
jumping. You know the old thing is so stingy.”</p>

<p>“Old thing, indeed! Why, she is not five&ndash;and&ndash;twenty!”</p>

<p>“I donʼt care; she has got a child. She is as
old as Methusalem in her heart, though she is so
deucedly sentimental”&mdash;the old Colonelʼs daughter
had not forgotten all her beloved papaʼs expressions&mdash;”I
know I shall use what you call in this
country ‘physical force,’ some day, with her. I
must have done it long ago, only for picking her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pocket. She would be but a baby in my hands,
and she is quite aware of it. Look at my arm;
itʼs no larger than yours, except above the elbow,
and it is nearly as soft and delicate. Yet I could
take you with one hand, Amy, and put you into
the brook. If you like, Iʼll do it.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, dear; but I am quite content
without the crucial test. I know your wonderful
strength, which none would ever suspect, to look
at you. I suppose it came to you from your
mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe. At any rate, I have heard my
father say so; and I could hold both his hands
most easily. But oh, she is such a screw, Amy,
that sympathetic Georgie! She never gives any
one sixpence; and it is so pleasant to hear her go
on about her money, and handkerchiefs, and, most
of all, her gloves. She is so proud of her nasty
little velvet paws. She wonʼt get her gloves except
in Southampton, and three toll&ndash;gates to pay, and
I steal them as fast as she gets them. She grumbles
about it all dinner&ndash;time, and I offered her
eighteenpence for turnpikes&mdash;out of her own purse,
of course&mdash;because she was so poor, I said. But
she flew into such a rage that I was forced to pick
her pocket again at breakfast&ndash;time next morning.
And the lies she told about the amount of money
in her purse! Between eight and nine pounds,
she said the last time, and there was only two
pounds twelve. Uncle Cradock made it good to
her, because he guessed that I had done it, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
he was afraid to tell me so. But, thank God, I
stole it again the next day when she went out
walking; and that of course he had nothing to say
to, because it did not occur in his house. Oh
what a rage she was in! She begins to suspect
me now, I think; but she never can catch me
out.”</p>

<p>“You consummate little thief! why, I shall be
afraid to come near you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I would never do it to any one but her.
And I should not do it to her so much, only she
thinks me a clumsy stupid. Me who was called
‘Never&ndash;spot&ndash;the&ndash;dust!’ But I have got another
thing of hers, and she had better take care, or Iʼll
open it.”</p>

<p>“Something else! Take care, Eoa, or I will
go and tell.”</p>

<p>“No, you know better than that. It is nothing
but a letter she wrote, and was going to post at
Burley. I knew by her tricks and suspicious ways
that there was something in it; and she would not
let it go in the post&ndash;bag. So I resolved to have
it; and of course I did. And she has been in
such a fright ever since; but I have not opened it
yet.”</p>

<p>“And I hope you never will. Either confess,
or post it at once, or never call me your friend
any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you need not be hot, Amy; you donʼt
understand the circumstances. I know that she
is playing a nasty game; and I need not have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
scruples with her, after what I caught her doing.
Twice she has been at my desk, my own new desk
Uncle Cradock gave me, where I put all the letters
and relics that were found on my dear, dear
father.” Here Eoa burst out crying, and Amy
came near again and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Darling, I did not mean to be cross; if the
wretch would do such a thing as that, it justifies
almost anything.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think I did?” said Eoa,
half crying, and half laughing: “I set a fishhook
with a spring to it, so that the moment she lifted
the cover, the barb would go into her hand; and
the next day she had a bad finger, and said that
little Flore bit it by accident while she was feeling
her tooth, which is loose. I should like to have
seen her getting the barb out of her nasty little
velvet paw.”</p>

<p>“I am quite surprised,” cried Amy; “and we
all call you so simple&mdash;a mere child of nature!
If so, nature is up to much more than we give
her credit for. And pray, what is your next
device?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing at all, till she does something. I
am quits with her now; and I cannot scheme as
she does.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Amy put both her hands on Eoaʼs
graceful shoulders, and poured the quick vigour
of English eyes into the fathomless lustre of
darkly&ndash;fringed Oriental orbs.</p>

<p>“You will not tell me a story, dear, if I ask you
very particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“I never tell stories to any one; you might
know that by this time. At any rate, not to my
friends.”</p>

<p>“No, I donʼt think you would. Now, do you
think that Mrs. Corklemore is at the bottom of
this vile thing?”</p>

<p>“What vile thing? The viler it is, the more
likely she is to have done it.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, she cannot have done it, though she
may have had something to do with it. I mean,
of course, about poor Cradock.”</p>

<p>“What about Cradock? I love Cousin Cradock,
because he is so unlucky; and because you like
him, dear.”</p>

<p>“Donʼt you know it? You must have seen that
I was in very poor spirits. And this made me feel
it so much the more, when you said what you did.
We have heard that an application has been made
in London, at the Home Office, or somewhere,
that a warrant should be issued against Cradock
Nowell, and a reward be offered for him as&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
my Cradock, my Craddy!”</p>

<p>“Put your head in here, darling. What a brute
you must have thought me! Oh, I do so love you.
Donʼt think twice about it, dear. I will take care
that it all comes right. I will go to London to&ndash;day,
dearest, and defy them to dare to do it. And
Iʼll open that letter at once. It becomes a duty
now; as that nasty beast always says, when she
wants to do anything wrong.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” sobbed Amy, “you have no right
to open her letter, and you shall not do it, Eoa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
unless my father says that it is right. Will you
promise me that, dear? Oh, do promise me that.”</p>

<p>“How can I promise that, when I would not have
him know, for a lac of rupees, that I had ever
stolen it? He would never perceive how right it
was; and, though I donʼt know much about
people, I am sure he would never forgive me. He
is such a fidget. But I will promise you one
thing, Amy&mdash;not to open it without <i>your</i> leave.”</p>

<p>Amy was obliged at last to be contented with
this; though she said it was worse than nothing,
for it forced the decision upon her; and, scrupulously
honest and candid as she was, she would
feel it right to settle the point against her own
desires.</p>

<p>“Old Biddy knows I have got it,” cried Eoa,
changing her humour: “and she patted me on the
back, and said, ‘Begorra, thin, you be the cliver
one; hould on to that same, me darlint, and weʼll
bate every bit of her, yit; the purtiest feet and
ancles to you, and the best back legs, more than
iver she got, and now you bate her in the stalinʼ.
And plase, Miss, rade yer ould Biddy every consuminʼ
word on it. Mullygaslooce, but weʼve
toorned her, this time, and thank Donats for it.’”</p>

<p>Eoa dramatised Biddy so cleverly, even to the
form of her countenance, and her peculiar manner
of standing, that Amy, with all those griefs upon
her, could not help laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“Come along, I canʼt mope any longer; when
I have jumped the brook nine times, you may say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
something to me. What do you think of a bathe,
Amy? I am up for it, if you are&mdash;and our tablecloths
for towels. Nobody comes here once in a
year; and if they did, they would run away again.
What a lovely deep pool! I can swim like a duck;
and you like a stone, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Amy, of course, would not hear of it, and her
lively friend, having paddled with her naked feet
in the water, and found it colder&mdash;oh, ever so
much&mdash;than the tributaries of the Ganges, was not
so very sorry (self&ndash;willed though being) to keep
upon the dry land, only she must go to Queenʼs
Mead, and Amy must come with her, and run the
entire distance, to get away from trouble.</p>

<p>Amy was light enough of foot, when her heart
was light; but Eoa could “run round her,” as the
sporting phrase is, and she gave herself the rein
at will that lovely afternoon; as a high&ndash;mettled
filly does, when she gets out of Piccadilly. And
she chatted as fast as she walked all the time,
hoping so to divert her friend from this new
distress.</p>

<p>“I should not be one bit surprised, if we saw
that&mdash;Bob, here somewhere. We are getting near
one of his favourite places&mdash;not that I know anything
about it; and he is always away now in
Mark Ash Wood, or Puckpits, looking out for the
arrival of honey&ndash;buzzards, or for a merlinʼs nest.
Oh, of course we shall not see him.”</p>

<p>“Now, you know you will,” replied Amy, laughing
at Eoaʼs clumsiness; “and you have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
me all this way for that very reason. Now, if we
meet him, just leave him to me, and stay out of
hearing. I will manage him so that he shall soon
think you the best and the prettiest girl in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish he would,” said Eoa, blushing
beautifully; “wouldnʼt I torment him then?”</p>

<p>“No doubt you would, and yourself as well.
Now where do you think he will be?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Amy, how can I possibly guess? But if
I did guess at all, I should say there was just an
atom of a chance of his being not far from the
Queenʼs Mead.”</p>

<p>“Suppose him to be there. What would bring
him there? Not to see you, I should hope?”</p>

<p>“As if he would go a yard for that! Oh no,
he is come to look for&mdash;at least, perhaps he might,
just possibly, I mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come to look for whom?” Amy was very
angry, for she thought that it was herself, under
Eoaʼs strategy.</p>

<p>“A horrid little white mole.”</p>

<p>“A white mole! Why, I had no idea that there
was such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, there is: but it is very rare; and he
has set his heart upon catching this one.”</p>

<p>“That he shanʼt. Oh, I see exactly what to do.
Come quickly, for fear he should catch it before
we get there. Oh, I do hate such cruelty. Ah,
there, I see him! Now, you keep out of sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>In a sunny break of tufted sward, embayed
among long waves of wood, young Bob Garnet
sat, more happy than the king of all the world of
fairies. At his side lay several implements of his
own devising, and on his lap a favourite book with
his open watch upon it. From time to time he
glanced away at a chain of little hillocks about
twenty yards in front of him, and among which
he had stuck seven or eight stout hazel rods, and
brought them down as benders. He was trying not
only to catch his mole, but also to add another to
his many observations as to the periods of molar
exertion. Whether nature does enforce upon those
clever miners any Three Hour Act, as the popular
opinion is; or whether they are free to work and
rest, at their own sweet will, as seems a world
more natural.</p>

<p>Amy walked into the midst of the benders, in
her self&ndash;willed, characteristic manner, as if they
were nothing at all. She made believe to see
nought of Bob, who, on the other side of the path
was fluttering and blushing, with a mixture of
emotions. “Some very cruel person,” she exclaimed,
in loud self&ndash;commune, “probably a cruel
boy, has been setting mole&ndash;traps here, I see. And
papa says the moles do more good than harm, except
perhaps in my flower&ndash;beds. Now Iʼll let them
all off very quietly. The boy will think he has
caught a dozen; and then how the moles will laugh
at him. He will think itʼs a witch, and leave off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
very likely, for all cruel boys are ignorant. My
pretty little darlings; so glossy, and so clever!”</p>

<p>“Oh, please not to do that,” cried Bob, having
tried in vain to contain himself, and now leaping
up in agony; “I have taken so much trouble, and
they are set so beautifully.”</p>

<p>“What, Master Robert Garnet! Oh, have you
seen my companion, Miss Nowell, about here?”</p>

<p>“Look there, you have spoiled another! And
theyʼll never set so well again. Oh, you canʼt
know what they are, and the trouble I have had
with them.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Master Garnet, I know what they are;
clumsy and cruel contrivances to catch my innocent
moles.”</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> moles!” cried Bob, with great wrath
arising, as she coolly destroyed two more traps;
“why are they <i>your</i> moles, I should like to know?
I donʼt believe you have ever even heard of them
before.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I have not?” answered Amy, screwing
up her lips, as she always did when resolved to
have her own way.</p>

<p>“Then how can they be your moles? Oh, if
you havenʼt spoiled another!”</p>

<p>“Well, Godʼs moles, if you prefer it, Master
Garnet. At any rate, you have no right to catch
them.”</p>

<p>“But I only want to catch one, Amy; a white
one, oh, such a beauty! I have heard of him since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
he was born, and had my eye on him down all the
galleries; and now he must be full&ndash;grown, for he
was born quite early in August.”</p>

<p>“I hope heʼll live to be a hundred. And I will
thank you, Master Garnet, to speak to <i>me</i> with
proper respect.”</p>

<p>Up went another riser. There was only one left
now, and that a most especial trap, which had cost
a whole weekʼs cogitation.</p>

<p>“I declare you are a most dreadful girl. You
donʼt like anything I do. And I have thought so
much of you.”</p>

<p>“Then, once for all, I beg you never more to
do so. I have often wished to speak with you upon
that very subject.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what subject, Miss Rosedew? I have
no idea what you mean.”</p>

<p>“That is altogether false. But I will tell you
now. I mean the silly, ungentlemanly, and very
childish manner, excusable only in such a boy, in
which I have several times observed you loitering
about in the forest.”</p>

<p>Bob knew what she meant right well, although
she would not more plainly express it&mdash;his tracking
of her footsteps. He turned as red as meadow&ndash;sorrel,
and stammered out what he could.</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;very&mdash;very sorry. But I did not mean
it. I mean&mdash;I could not help it.”</p>

<p>“You will be kind enough to help it now, for
once and for all. Otherwise, my father, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
not heard of it yet, shall speak to yours about it.
Insufferable impudence in a boy just come from
school!”</p>

<p>Amy was obliged to turn away, for fear he
should look up again, and see the laughter in her
eyes. For all her wrath was feigned, inasmuch
as to her Bob Garnet was far too silly a butterfly&ndash;boy
to awake any real anger. But of late he
had been intrusive, and it seemed high time to
stop it.</p>

<p>“If I have done anything wrong, Miss Rosedew,
anything in any way unbecoming a gentleman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, try to be a good boy again,” said Amy,
very graciously; at the same time giving the
stroke of grace to his masterpiece of mechanism,
designed to catch the white mole alive; “now
take up your playthings and go, if you please;
for I expect a young lady here directly; and your
little tools for cockchafer&ndash;spinning would barbarize
the foreground of our sketch, besides being very
ugly.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Bob, with a sudden access of his
fathers readiness&mdash;”you spin a fellow worse than
any cockchafer, and you do it in the name of
humanity!”</p>

<p>“Then think me no more a divinity,” answered
Amy; because she must have the last word; and
even Bob, young as he was, knew better than to
paragogize the feminine termination. Utterly discomfited,
as a boy is by a woman&mdash;and Amyʼs trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
had advanced her almost to that proud claim&mdash;Bob
gathered up his traps and scuttled cleverly out of
sight. She, on the other hand (laughing all the
while at herself for her simple piece of acting, and
doubting whether she had been right in doing
even a little thing so much against her nature),
there she sat, with her sketching&ndash;block ready, and
hoped that Eoa would have the wit to come and
meet her beloved Bob, now labouring under his
fierce rebuff.</p>

<p>But Eoa could not do it. She had wit enough,
but too much heart. She had heard every word of
Amyʼs insolence, and was very indignant at it. Was
Bob to be talked to in that way? As if he knew
nothing of science! As if he really had an atom
of any sort of cruelty in him! Was Amy so very
ignorant as not to know that all Bob did was done
with the kindest consideration, and for the interest
of the species, though the pins through the backs
were unpleasant, perhaps? But that was over in a
moment, and he always carried ether; and it was
nothing to the Fakirs, or the martyrs of Christianity.</p>

<p>Therefore Eoa crouched away, behind a tuft of
thicket, because her maidenhood forbade her to
come out and comfort him, to take advantage of
his wrong, and let him know how she felt it.
Therefore, too, she was very sharp with Amy all
the homeward road; vindicating Bob, and snapping
at all proffered softness; truth being that she
had suspected his boyish whim for Amy, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
was sorry for him about it, and very angry with
both of them.</p>

<p>From that little touch of womanʼs nature she
learned more dignity, more pride, more reservation,
and self&ndash;respect, than she could have won
from a score of governesses, or six seasons of
“society.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="p2">“Not another minute to lose, and the sale again
deferred! All the lots marked, and the handbills
out, and the particulars and conditions ready;
and then some paltry pettifogging, and another
fortnight will be required to do ‘justice to my
interests.’ Justice to my interests! How they do
love round&ndash;mouthed rubbish! The only justice to
me is, from a legal point of view, to string me up,
and then quick&ndash;lime me; and the only justice to
my interests is to rob my children, because I have
robbed them already. Robbed them of their birth
and name, their power to look men in the face,
their chance of being allowed to do what God
seems chiefly to want us for&mdash;to marry and have
children, who may be worse than we are; though,
thank Him, mine are not. Robbed them even of
their chance to be met as Christians (though I
have increased their right to it), in this wretched,
money&ndash;seeking, servile, and contemptuous age. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
who am I to find fault with any, after all my wasted
life? A life which might, in its little way, have
told upon the people round me, and moved, if not
improved them. Which might, at least, have set
them thinking, doubting, and believing. Oh the
loss of energy, the loss of self&ndash;reliance, and the
awful load of fear and anguish&mdash;I who might have
been so different! Pearl is at the window there.
I know quite well who loves her&mdash;an honest, upright,
hearty man, with a true respect for women.
But will he look at her when he knows&mdash;&mdash;Oh
God, my God, forsake me, but not my children!&mdash;Bob,
what are you at with those cabbages?”</p>

<p>“Why, they are clubbed, donʼt you see, father,
beautifully clubbed already, and the leaves flag
directly the sun shines. And I want to know
whether it is the larva of a <i>curculio</i>, or <i>anthomyia
brassicæ</i>; and I canʼt tell without pulling the
plants up, and they canʼt come to any good, you
know, with all this ambury in them.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of the sort, Bob. I know nothing
at all about it. Go into the house to your
sister. I canʼt bear the sight of you now.”</p>

<p>Bob, without a single word, did as he was told.
He knew that his father loved him, though he
could not guess the depth of that love, being himself
so different. And so he never took offence at
his fatherʼs odd ways to him, but thought, “Better
luck next time; the governor has got red spider
this morning, and he wonʼt be right till dinner&ndash;time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet smiled at his sonʼs obedience, with
a mighty fount of pride in him; and then he
sighed, because Bob was gone&mdash;and he never
could have enough of him, for the little time
remaining. He loved his son with a love surpassing
that of woman, or that of man for woman.
Men would call him a fool for it. But God knows
how He has made us.</p>

<p>Thinking none of this, but fretting over fierce
heart&ndash;troubles, which now began to be too many
even for his power of life&mdash;as a hundred wolves
kill a lion&mdash;he turned again down the espalier&ndash;walk,
where the apple&ndash;trees were in blossom.
Pinky shells spread to the sun, with the little close
tuft in the middle; some striped, some patched,
some pinched with white, some streaking as the
fruit would be, and glancing every gloss of blush&mdash;no
two of them were quite alike, any more than
two of us are. Yet the bees knew every one
among the countless multitude, and never took the
wrong one; even as the angels know which of us
belongs to them, and who wants visitation.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet, casting to and fro, and taking heed
of nothing, not even of the weeds which once could
not have lived before his eyes, began again in a
vague loose manner (the weakness of which would
have angered him, if he had been introspective) to
drone about the lawʼs delays, and the folly of institution.
He stood at last by his wicket gate, where
the hedge of Irish yew was, and there carried on
his grumbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lawyers indeed! And cannot manage a simple
thing of that sort! Thank God, I know nothing of
law.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Garnet. It is possible that
you may want to know something of law, shortly.”</p>

<p>“By what right, sir, dare you break in upon my
privacy like this?”</p>

<p>Pale as he was, and scorning himself for the
way in which his blood shrunk back, Bull Garnet
was far too strong and quick ever to be dumb&ndash;foundered.
Chope looked at him, with some
admiration breaking through the triumph of his
small comprehensive eyes.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Garnet. I forgot that a
public man like you must have his private moments,
even at his own gate. I am sorry to see
you so hot, my dear sir; though I have heard that
it is your character. That sort of thing leads to
evil results, and many deplorable consequences.
But I did not mean to be rude to you, or to disturb
you so strangely.”</p>

<p>“You have not disturbed me at all, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am truly happy to hear it. All I meant, as
to knowledge of law, was to give you notice that
there is some heavy trouble brewing, and that you
must be prepared to meet some horrible accusations.”</p>

<p>“May I trespass further upon your kindness, to
ask what their subject is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing more than a very rash and unfounded
charge of murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chope pronounced that last awful word in
a deeply sepulchral manner, and riveted his little
eyes into Bull Garnetʼs great ones. Mr. Garnet
met his gaze as calmly as he would meet the sad
clouded aspect of a dead rabbit, or hare, in a shop
where he asked the price of them, and regarded
their eyes as the test of their freshness. Chope
could not tell what to make of it. The thing was
beyond his experience.</p>

<p>But all this time Bull Garnet felt that every
minute was costing him a year of his natural life,
even if he ever got any chance of living it out.</p>

<p>“How does this concern me? Is it any one on
our estates?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the heir to ‘your estates.’ Young
Mr. Cradock Nowell.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet sighed very heavily; then he strode
away, and came back again, with indignation
swelling out the volume of his breast, and filling
the deep dark channels of brow, and the turgid veins
of his eyeballs.</p>

<p>“Whoever has done this thing is a fool; or a
rogue&mdash;which means the same.”</p>

<p>“It may be so. It may be otherwise. We
always hope for the best. Very likely he is innocent.
Perhaps they are shooting at the pigeon in
order to hit the crow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you know best what their motives are.
I see no use in canvassing them. You have heard,
I suppose, the rumour that Mr. Cradock Nowell
has left England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“I know very little about it. I have nothing to
do with the case; or it might have been managed
differently. But I heard that the civil authorities,
being called upon to act, discovered, without much
trouble, that he had sailed, under a false name, in
a ship called the <i>Taprobane</i>, bound direct for
Ceylon. And that, of course, told against him
rather heavily.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he sailed for Ceylon, did he? A wonderful
place for insects. I had an uncle who died
there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ceylon, where the flying foxes are. Not
so cunning, perhaps, as our foxes of the Forest.
And yet the fox is a passionate animal. Violent,
hot, and hasty. Were you aware of that fact?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me; my time is valuable. I will send
for the gamekeeper, if you wish to have light
thrown upon that question; or my son will be only
too glad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, your son! Poor fellow!”</p>

<p>Those few short words, pronounced in a tone of
real feeling, with no attempt at inquiry, quite
overcame Bull Garnet. First extrinsic proof of
that which he had so long foreseen with horror&mdash;the
degradation of his son. He dropped his eyes,
which had borne, till now, and returned the lawyerʼs
gaze; and the sense of his own peril failed to keep
the tears from moving. Up to this time Mr. Chope
had doubted, and was even beginning to reject his
shrewd and well&ndash;founded conclusion. Now he saw
and knew everything. And even he was overcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Passion is infectious; and lawyers are
like the rest of us. Mr. Chope had loved his
mother.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet gave one quick strange glance at
the eyes of Simon Chope, which now were turned
away from him, and then he looked at the ground,
and said,</p>

<p>“Yes; I have wronged him bitterly.”</p>

<p>Simon Chope drew back from him mechanically,
instinctively, as our skin starts from cold
iron in the arctic regions. He could not think,
much less could he speak, though his mind had
been prepared for it. To human nature it is so
abhorrent to take the life of another: to usurp the
rights of God. To stand in the presence of one
who has done it, touches our pulse with death. We
feel that he might have done it to us, or that we
might have done it to him; and our love of ourselves
is at once accelerated and staggered. And
then we feel that “life for life” is such low revenge;
the vendetta of a drunkard. Very slowly we are
beginning to see the baseness of it.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet was the first to speak, and now he
spoke quite calmly.</p>

<p>“You came with several purposes. One of them
was, that I should break to Sir Cradock Nowell
these tidings of new trouble; the news of the warrant
which you and others have issued against his
luckless son. I will see to it to&ndash;day, and I will try
to tell him. Good God, he does not deserve it&mdash;I
have watched him&mdash;he is no father. Oh, I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
you had a son, Chope; then you could feel for
me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chope had two sons, not to be freely discoursed
of; whom he meant to take into the office,
pseudonymously, some day; and he was rather inclined
to like the poor little <i>nullius filii</i>. First,
because they were his own; secondly, because they
had big heads; thirdly, because they had cheated
all the other boys. Nevertheless, he was in no
hurry to be confidential about them. Yet without
his knowing it, or at least with only despising it,
this little matter shaped its measure upon his present
action. The lawyer lifted his hat to Bull
Garnet in a very peculiar manner, conveying to
the quick apprehension, what it would not have
been safe to pronounce&mdash;to wit, that Mr. Chope
quite understood all that had occurred; that he
would not act upon his discovery until he had well
considered the matter, for, after all, he had no evidence;
lastly, that he was very sorry for Mr. Garnetʼs
position, but would rather not shake hands
with him.</p>

<p>The steward watched him walking softly among
the glad young leaves, and down the dell where
the sunlight flashed on the merry leaps of the water.
Long after the lawyer was out of sight, Bull
Garnet stood there watching, as if the forest glades
would show him the approaching destiny. Strong
and firm as his nature was, he had suffered now
such wearing, wearying agonies, that he almost
wished the weak manʼs wish&mdash;to have the mastery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
taken from him, to have the issue settled without
his own decision.</p>

<p>“Poor Cradock sailed in the <i>Taprobane</i>! What
an odd name,” he continued, with that childishness
to which sometimes the overtaxed brain reverts,
“tap, tap&ndash;root, tap&ndash;robin! Tush, what a fool I
am! Oh God, that I could think! Oh God, that
I could only learn whether my first duty is to you,
or to my children. I will go in and pray.”</p>

<p>In the passage he met his son, and kissed his
forehead gently, as if to atone for the harshness
with which he had sent him away.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Bob, “shall you want me to&ndash;day?
Or may I be from home till dark? I have
so many things, most important things, to see to.”</p>

<p>“Birds’ nests, I suppose, and grubs, field&ndash;mice,
and tadpoles. Yes, my son, you are wise. Enjoy
them while you can. And take your sister also for
a good run, if you can. You may carry your dinner
with you: I shall do well enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, itʼs no use asking Pearl; she never will
come with me. And I am sure I donʼt want her.
She does much more harm than good; she canʼt
kill anything properly, nor even blow an egg. But
Iʼll ask her, as you wish it, sir; because I know
that she wonʼt come.”</p>

<p>Mr. Garnet had not the heart to laugh at his
childrenʼs fine sense of duty towards him; but he
saw Bob start with all his tackle, in great hopes, and
high spirits. The father looked sadly after him,
wondering at his enjoyment, yet loving him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
more, perhaps, for being so unlike himself. And
as he gazed, he could not help saying to himself,
“Very likely I shall never see him thus again&mdash;only
look at him when he will not care to look on
me. Yet he must know, in the end, and she, the
poor thing, she must know how all my soul was on
them. Now God in heaven, lead me aright. Half
an hour shall settle it.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile, supposing the warrant to issue,
let us see what chance there is of its ever being
served. And it may be a pleasant change awhile
to flit to southern latitudes from the troubles and
the drizzle, and the weeping summer of England.</p>

<p>Poor Cradock, as we saw him last, backed up
by the ebony&ndash;tree, and with Wena crouching close
to him, knew nothing of his lonely plight and
miserable abandonment; until the sheets of plashing
rain, and long howls of his little dog, awoke
him to great wonderment. Then he arose, and
rubbed his eyes, and thought that his sight was
gone, and felt a heavy weight upon him, and a
destiny to grope about, and a vain desire to scream,
such as we have in nightmare. Meanwhile, he felt
something pulling at him, always in the same direction,
and he did not like to put his hand down, for
he had some idea that it was Beelzebub. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a great flash of lightning, triple thrice repeated,
lit up the whole of the wood, like day; and he saw
black Wena tugging at him, to draw him into
good shelter. He saw the shelter also, ere the
gush of light was gone, an enormous and hollow
mowana&ndash;tree, a little higher up the hill. Then all
was blackest night again; and even Wena was
swallowed up in it. But with both hands stretched
out, to fend the blows of hanging branch or
creeper, he committed himself to the little dogʼs
care, and she took him to the mowana&ndash;tree. Then
another great flash lit up all the hollow; and
Wena was frightened and dropped her tail, but
still held on to her master.</p>

<p>Cradock neither knew, nor cared, what the name
of the tree was, nor whether it possessed, as some
trees do, especial attractions for lightning. “Any
harbour in a storm,” was all he thought, if he
thought at all; and he lay down very snugly, and
felt for Amyʼs present to him, and then, in spite of
the crashing thunder and the roaring wind, snugly
he went off to sleep; and at his feet lay Wena.</p>

<p>In the bright morning, the youth arose, and
shook himself, and looked round, and felt rather
jolly than otherwise. Travellers say that the baobab,
or mowana&ndash;tree, is the hardest of all things to kill,
and will grow along the ground, when uprooted,
and not allowed to grow upright. Frenchmen have
proved, to their own satisfaction, that some baobabs,
now living, grew under the deluge of Noah, and
not improbably had the great ark floating over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
their heads. Be that as it may, and though it is a
Cadmeian job to cut down the baobab, for every
root thereupon claims, and takes, a distinct existence;
we can all of us tell the travellers of a thing
yet harder to kill&mdash;the hope in the heart of a man.
And, the better man he is, the more of hopeʼs
spores are in him; and the quicker they grow
again, after they have all been stamped upon. A
mushroom in the egg likes well to have the ground
beaten overhead with a paviourʼs rammer, and
comes up all the bigger for it, and lifts a pave&ndash;stone
of two hundred&ndash;weight. Shall then the pluck of
an honest man fail, while his true conscience stirs
in him, though the result be like a fleeting fungus,
supposed to be born in an hour by those who know
nothing about it, and who make it the type of an
upstart&mdash;shall not his courage work and spread,
although it be underground, as he grows less and
less defiant; and rear, perhaps in the autumn of
life, a genuine crop, and a good one?</p>

<p>Cradock Nowell found his island not at all a
bad one. There was plenty to eat at any rate,
which is half the battle of life. Plenty to drink is
the other half, in the judgment of many philosophers.
But I think that plenty to look at it ought
to be at least a third of it. The pride of the
eyes, if not exercised on that vanishing point, oneself,
is a pride legitimate, and condemned by no
apostle. And here there was noble food for it;
and it is a pride which, when duly fed, slumbers
off into humility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh the glory of everything, the promise, and the
brightness; the large leading views of sky and
sea, and the crystal avenues onward. The manner
in which a fellow expands, when he looks at such
things&mdash;if he be capable of expanding, which
surely all of us are&mdash;the way in which he wonders,
and never dreams about wondering, and the feeling
of grandeur growing within him, and how it repents
him of littleness, and all his foes are forgiven;
and then he sees that he has something
himself to do with all the beauty of it&mdash;upon my
word, I am a great fool, to attempt to tell of it.</p>

<p>Cradock saw his lovely island, and was well
content with it. It was not more than four miles
long, and perhaps three miles across; but it was
gifted with three grand things&mdash;beauty, health, and
nourishment. It might have been ages, for all he
saw then, since man had sworn or forsworn in it;
perhaps none since the voyagers of Necho, whose
grand truth was so incredible. There were no
high hills, and no very deep holes; but a pleasant
undulating place, ever full of leaves and breezes.
And as for wild beasts, he had no fear; he knew
that they would require more square miles than
he owned. As for snakes, he was not so sure;
and indeed there were some nasty ones, as we shall
see by&ndash;and&ndash;by.</p>

<p>Then he went to the shore, and looked far away,
even after the <i>Taprobane</i>. The sea was yet heaving
heavily, and tumbling back into itself with a
roar, and some fishing eagles were very busy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
stooping along the foam of it; but no ship was to
be seen anywhere, and far away in the south and
south&ndash;east the selvage of black clouds, lopping over
the mist of the horizon, showed that still the
typhoon was there, and no one could tell how bad
it was.</p>

<p>Cradock found a turtle, at which Wena looked
first in mute wonder, with her eyes taking jumps
from their orbits, and then, like all females, she
found tongue, and ran away, and barked furiously.
Presently she came back, sniffing along, and drawing
her nose on the sand, yet determined to stick
by her master, even if the turtle should eat him.
But, to her immense satisfaction, the result was
quite the converse: she and her master ate the
turtle; beginning, <i>ab ovo</i>, that morning.</p>

<p>For, although Crad could not quite eat the
eggs raw (by&ndash;the&ndash;by, they are not so bad that way),
and although he could not quite strike a light by
twirling one stick in the back of another, he had
long ago found reason <i>for</i>, and he rapidly found
that excellent goddess <i>in</i>, the roasting of eggs.
And for that, he had to thank Amy. Only see
how thoughtful women are!&mdash;yes, a mark of
astonishment.</p>

<p>But the astonishment will subside, perhaps, when
we come to know all about it; for then all the
misogynes may declare that the thought was born
of vanity. Let them do so. Facts are facts,
I say.</p>

<p>Amy had sent him a photograph of her faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
self, beautifully done by Mr. Silvy, of Bayswater,
and framed in a patent loverʼs box, I forget the
proper name for it&mdash;something French, of course&mdash;so
ingeniously contrived, that when a spring at
the back was pressed, a little wax match would present
itself, from a lining of asbestos, together with
a groove to draw it in. Thus by night, as well as
by day, the smile of the loved one might illumine
the lonely heart of the lover.</p>

<p>Now this device stood him in good stead&mdash;as
doubtless it was intended to do by the practical
mind of the giver&mdash;for it served to light the fire
wherewith man roasteth roast, and is satisfied.
And a fire once lit in the hollow heart of that vast
mowana&ndash;tree (where twenty men might sit and
smoke, when the rainy season came), if you only
supplied some fuel daily, and cleared away the
ashes weekly, there need be no fear of philanthropy
making a trespasser of Prometheus. Cradock soon
resolved to keep his head&ndash;quarters there, for the
tree stood upon a little hill, overlooking land and
sea, for many a league of solitude. And it was not
long before he found that the soft bark of the
baobab might easily be cut so as to make a winding
staircase up it; and the work would be an amusement
to him, as well as a great advantage.</p>

<p>Master and dog having made a most admirable
breakfast upon turtles’ eggs, “roasted very knowingly”&mdash;as
Homer well expresses it&mdash;with a large
pineapple to follow, started, before the heat of the
day, in search of water, the indispensable. Shaddocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and limes, and mangosteens, bananas&mdash;with
their long leaves quilling&mdash;pineapples, mawas, and
mamoshoes, cocoa&ndash;nuts, plantains, mangoes, palms,
and palmyras, custard&ndash;apples, and gourds without
end&mdash;besides fifty other ground&ndash;fruits, ay, and
tree&ndash;fruits for that matter, quite unknown to Cradock,
there was no fear of dying from drought;
and yet the first thing to seek was pure water. If
Cradock had thought much about the thing, very
likely it would have struck him that some of the
fruits which he saw are proof not so much of
human cultivation, as of human presence, at some
time.</p>

<p>But he never thought about that; and indeed
his mind was too full for thinking. So he cut
himself a most tremendous bludgeon of camelthorn,
as heavy and almost as hard as iron, and off
he went whistling, with Wena wondering whether
the stick would beat her.</p>

<p>He certainly took things easily; more so than is
quite in accord with human nature and reason.
But the state of his mind was to blame for it; and
the freshness of the island air, after the storm of
the night.</p>

<p>Even a rejected lover, or a disconsolate husband,
gives a jerk to his knee&ndash;joints, and carries his
elbows more briskly, when the bright spring morning
shortens his shadow at every step. Cradock,
moreover, felt quite sure that he would not be left
too long there; that his friends on board the
<i>Taprobane</i> would come aside from their track to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
find him, on their return&ndash;voyage from Ceylon;
and so no doubt they would have done, if it had
been in their power. But the <i>Taprobane</i>, as we
shall see, never made her escape, in spite of weatherly
helm and good seamanship, from the power
of that typhoon. She was lost on the shoals of
Benguela Bay, thirty miles south of Quicombo;
and not a man ever reached the shore to tell the
name of the ship. But a Portuguese half&ndash;caste,
trading there, found the name on a piece of the
taffrail, and a boat which was driven ashore.</p>

<p>After all, we see then that Cradock was wonderfully
lucky&mdash;at least, if it be luck to live&mdash;in having
been left behind, that evening, on an uninhabited
island. “Desolate” nobody could call it, for the
gifts of life lay around in abundance, and he soon
had proof that the feet of men, ay, of white men,
trod it sometimes. Following the shore, a little
further than the sailors had gone, he came on a
pure narrow thread of crystal, a current of bright
water dimpling and twinkling down the sand.
Wena at once lay down and rolled, and wetted
every bit of herself; and then began to lap the
water wherein her own very active and industrious
friends were drowning. That Wena was such a
ladylike dog; she washed herself before drinking,
and she never would wash in salt water. It made
her hair so unbecoming.</p>

<p>Cradock followed up that stream, and found
quite a tidy little brook, when he got above the
sand&ndash;ridge, full of fish, and fringed with trees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
edged with many a quaint bright bird, scissor&ndash;bills
and avosets, demoiselles and flamingoes. Wena
plunged in and went hunting blue&ndash;rats, and birds,
and fishes, while her master stooped down, and
drank, and thanked God for this discovery.</p>

<p>A little way up the brook he found a rude shanty,
a sort of wigwam, thatched with leaves and waterproof,
backed by a low rock, but quite open in
front and at both ends. Under the shelter were
blocks of ebony, billets of bar&ndash;wood piled up to the
roof, a dozen tusks of ivory, bales of dried bark,
and piles of rough cylinders full of caoutchouc, and
many other things which Cradock could not wait
to examine. But he felt quite certain that this
must be some traderʼs depôt for shipping: the only
thing that surprised him was that the goods were
left unprotected. For he knew that the West
Africans are the biggest thieves in the world,
while he did not understand the virtue of the
hideous great Fetich, hanging there.</p>

<p>It was made of a long dried codfish, with glass
eyes, ground in the iris, and polished again in the
pupil, and a glaring stripe of red over them, and
the neck of a bottle fixed as for a tongue, and the
body skewered open and painted bright blue, ribbed
with white, like a skeleton, and the tail prolonged
with two spinal columns, which rattled as it went
round. The effect of the whole was greatly increased
by the tattered cage of crinoline in which
it was suspended, and which went creaking round,
now and then, in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>No nigger would dare to steal anything from
such a noble idol. At least so thought the Yankee
trader who knew a thing or two about them. He
had left his things here in perfect faith, while he
was travelling towards the Gaboon, to complete
his cargo.</p>

<p>Cradock was greatly astounded. He thought
that it must be a white manʼs work; and soon he
became quite certain, for he saw near a cask the
clear mark of a boot, of civilized make, unquestionably.
Then he prized out the head of the cask,
after a deal of trouble, and found a store of ship&ndash;biscuit,
a little the worse for weevil, but in very
fair condition. He gave Wena one, but she would
not touch it, for she set much store by her teeth,
and had eaten a noble breakfast.</p>

<p>Having made a rough examination of the deserted
shed, and found no sort of clothing&mdash;which did not
vex him much, except that he wanted shoes&mdash;he
resolved to continue the circuit of his new
dominions, and look out perhaps for another hut.
He might meet a man at any time; so he carried
his big stick ready, though none but cannibals
could have any good reason to hurt him. As he
went on, and struck inland to cut off the northern
promontory, the lie of the land and the look of the
woods brought to his mind more clearly and brightly
his own beloved New Forest. He saw no quadruped
larger than a beautiful little deer, lighter
than a gazelle, and of a species quite unknown to
him. They stood and looked at him prettily, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
either fear or defiance, and Wena wanted to
hunt them. But he did not allow her to indulge
that evil inclination. He had made up his mind
to destroy nothing, even for his own subsistence,
except the cold&ndash;blooded creatures which seem to
feel less of the death&ndash;pang. But he saw a foul
snake, with a flat heavy head, which hissed at and
frightened the doggie, and he felt sure that it was
venomous: monkeys also of three varieties met him
in his pilgrimage, and seemed disposed to be sociable;
while birds of every tint and plumage
fluttered, and flashed, and flitted. Then Wena
ran up to him howling, and limping, and begging
for help; and he found her clutched by the seed&ndash;vessels
of the terrible uncaria. He could scarcely
manage to get them off, for they seemed to be
crawling upon her.</p>

<p>When he had made nearly half his circuit, without
any other discovery&mdash;except that the grapes
were worthless&mdash;the heat of the noonday sun grew
so strong, although it was autumn there&mdash;so far as
they have any autumn&mdash;that Cradock lay down in
the shade of a plantain; and, in a few seconds
afterwards, was fast asleep and dreaming. Wena
sat up on guard and snapped at the nasty poisonous
flies, which came to annoy her master.</p>

<p>How heavenly tropical life would be, in a beautiful
country like that, but for those infernal insects!
The mosquito, for instance,&mdash;and he is an angel,
compared to some of those Beelzebubs,&mdash;must have
made Adam swear at Eve, even before the fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
And then those awful spiders, whose hair tickles a
man to madness, even if he survives the horror of
seeing such devils. And then the tampan&mdash;but
let us drop the subject, please, for fear of not sleeping
to&ndash;night. Cradock awoke in furious pain, and
spasms most unphilosophical. He had dreamed
that he was playing football upon Cowley Green,
and had kicked out nobly with his right foot into a
marching line of red ants. Immediately they
swarmed upon him, up him, over him, into him,
biting with wild virulence, and twisting their heads
and nippers round in every wound to exasperate it.
Wena was rolling and yelling, for they attacked
her too. Cradock thought they would kill him;
although he did not know that even the python
succumbs to them. He was as red all over, inside
his clothes and outside, as if you had winnowed
over him a bushel of fine rouge. Dancing, and
stamping, and recalling, with heartfelt satisfaction,
some strong words learned at Oxford, he caught up
Wena, and away they went, two solid lumps of
ants, headlong into the sea. Luckily he had not
far to go; he lay down and rolled himself, clothes
and all, and rolled poor Wena too in the waves,
until he had the intense delight of knowing that he
had drowned a million of them. Ah! and just
now he had made up his mind to respect every
form of life so.</p>

<p>Oh, but I defy any fellow, even the sage Archbishop
who reads novels to stop other people, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
have lectured us under the circumstances, or to
have kept his oaths in, with those twenty thousand
holes in him. The salt water went into Cradockʼs
holes, and made him feel like a Cayenne peppercastor;
and the little dog sat in the froth of the
sea, and thought that even dogs are allowed a hell.</p>

<p>After that there was nothing to do, except to go
home mournfully&mdash;if a tree may be called a home,
as no doubt it deserves to be&mdash;and then to dry the
clothes, and wish that the wearer knew something
of botany. Cradock had no doubt at all that
around him grew whole stacks of leaves which
would salve and soothe his desperate pain; but he
had not the least idea which were balm and which
were poison. How he wished that, instead of
reading so hard for the scholarship of Dean Ireland,
he had kept his eyes open in the New Forest,
and learned just Natureʼs rudiments! Of course he
would have other leaves to deal with; but certain
main laws and principles hold good all the world
over. Bob Garnet would have been quite at
home, though he had never seen one of those
plants before.</p>

<p>We cannot follow him, day by day. It is too late
in the tale for that, even if we wished it. Enough
that he found no other trace of man upon the island,
except the traderʼs hut, or store, with the hideous
scarecrow hanging, and signs of human labour, in
the growth of some few trees&mdash;about which he
knew nothing&mdash;and in a rough piece of ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
near the shanty, cleared for a kitchen&ndash;garden.
Cassavas, and yams, and kiobos, and pea&ndash;nuts, and
some other things, grew there; which, as he made
nothing of them, we must treat likewise. There
had even been some cotton sown, but the soil seemed
not to suit it. It was meant, perhaps, by the keen
American, who thought himself lord of the island,
for a little random experiment.</p>

<p>When would he come back? That was the
question Cradock asked, both of himself and
Wena, twenty times a day. Of course poor
Cradock knew not whether his lord of the manor
were a Yankee or a Britisher, a Portuguese or a
Dutchman; “Thebis nutritus an Argis.” Only he
supposed and hoped that a white man came to that
island sometimes, and brought other white men
with him.</p>

<p>By this time, he had cut a winding staircase up
the walls of his castle, and added a great many
rough devices to his rugged interior. Twice every
day he clomb his tree, to seek all round the
horizon; and at one time he saw a sail in the
distance, making perhaps for Loanda. But that
ship was even outside the expansive margin of
hope. And now he divided his time between his
grand mowana citadel and the storehouse, with
whose contents he did not like to meddle much,
because they were not his property.</p>

<p>There he placed the shipʼs hydropult, which he
had found lying on the beach; for the mate had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
brought it to meet the chance of finding shallow
water, where the casks could not be stooped or the
water bailed without fouling it; and the boatʼs
crew, in their rush and flurry, had managed to
leave it behind them. Cradock left it in the storehouse,
because it was useless to him where he had
no water, and it amused him sometimes to syringe
Wena from the brook which flowed hard by.
Moreover, he thought that if anything happened
to prevent him from explaining things, the owner
of the place, whoever he might be, would find in
that implement more than the value of the biscuits
which Cradock was eating, and getting on nicely
with them, because they corrected the richness of
turtle.</p>

<p>Truly, his diet was glorious, both in quality and
variety; and he very soon became quite a pomarian
Apicius. Of all fruits, perhaps the mangosteen
(<i>Garcinia mangostana</i>) is the most delicious,
when you get the right sort of it&mdash;which I donʼt
think they have in Brazil&mdash;neither is the lee chee
a gift to be despised, nor the chirimoya, and
several others of the Annona race; some of the
Granadillas, too, and the sweet lime, and the
plantains, and many another fount of beauty and
delight&mdash;all of which, by skill and care, might be
raised in this country, where we seem to rest content
with our meagre hothouse catalogue.</p>

<p>I do not say that all these fruits were natives of
“Pomona Island,” as Cradock, appreciating its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
desserts, took the liberty of naming it; but most
of them were discoverable in one part or another of
it; some born from the breast of nature, others
borne by man or tide. And almost all of them
still would be greatly improved by cultivation.</p>

<p>So the head gardener of the island, who left the
sun to garden for him, enjoyed their exquisite
coolness, and wondered how they could be so cool
in the torrid sunshine; and though he did not
know the name of one in fifty of them, he found
out wonderfully soon which of them were the
nicest. And soon he discovered another means of
varying his diet, for he remembered having read
that often, in such lonely waters, the swarming
fish will leap on board of a boat floating down the
river. Thereupon he made himself a broad flat
tray of bark, with a shallow ledge around it, and
holding a tow&ndash;rope, made also of bark, launched it
upon the brook. Immediately a vast commotion
arose among the finny ones; they hustled, and
huddled, and darted about, and then paddled
gravely and stared at it. Then, whether from
confusion of mind, or the reproaches of their
comrades, or the desire of novelty, half a dozen
fine fellows made a rush, and carried the ship by
boarding. Whereupon Cradock, laughing heartily,
drew his barge ashore, and soon Wena and himself
were deep in a discussion ichthyological.</p>

<p>As may well be supposed, the pure sea breezes
and wholesome diet, the peace and plenty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
motherly influence of nature, the due exercise of
the body, without undue stagnation of mind, the
pleasure of finding knowledge expand every day,
stomachically, while body and mind were girded
alike, and the heart impressed with the diamond&ndash;studded
belt of hope&mdash;all this, we may well suppose,
was beginning to try severely the nasal joints
of incessant woe.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="p2">But Pomona Island, now and then, had its own
little cares and anxieties. How much longer was
Cradock Nowell to live upon fruit, and fish, and
turtle, with ship&ndash;biscuit for dessert? When would
the trader come for his goods, or had he quite forgotten
them? What would Amy and Uncle John
think, if the <i>Taprobane</i> went home without him?
And the snakes, the snakes, that cared not a rap
for the enmity of man, since the rainy season set
in, but came almost up to be roasted! And worst
of all and most terrible thing, Crad was obliged to
go about barefooted, while the thorns were of natureʼs
invention, and went every way all at once,
like a hedgehog upon a frying&ndash;pan.</p>

<p>For that last evil he found a cure before he had
hopped many hundred yards. He discovered a
pumpkin about a foot long, pointed, and with a
horny rind, and contracted towards the middle.
He sliced this lengthwise, and took out the seeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and planted his naked foot there. The coolness
was most delicious, and a few strips of baobab bark
made a first&ndash;rate shoe of it. He wore out one pair
every day, and two when he went exploring; but
what did that matter, unless the supply failed?
and he kept some hung up for emergency.</p>

<p>As to the snakes, though he did not find out the
snake&ndash;wood, or the snake&ndash;stone, or the fungoid
substance, like a morel, which pumices up the
venom; he invented something much better, as
prevention is better than cure. He discovered a
species of aspalathus, perfectly smooth near the
root, and not very hard to pull up, yet so barbed,
and toothed, and fanged upon all except the seed&ndash;leaves,
that even a python&mdash;whereof he had none&mdash;could
scarcely have got through it. Of this he
strewed a ring all round his great mowana&ndash;tree,
and then a fenced path down the valley toward
his bathing&ndash;place, and then he defied the whole of
that genus so closely akin to the devil.</p>

<p>But Wena had saved his life ere this from
one of those slimy demons. Of course we know
how hateful it is to hate anything at all,
except sin and crime in the abstract; but I do
hope a fellow may be forgiven for hating snakes
and scorpions. At any rate, if he cannot be, he
ought to be able to help it. While Cradock was
making his fence aspalathine, and before he had
finished the ring yet, a little snake about two feet
long, semi&ndash;transparent, and jellified, of a dirty
bottle&ndash;green colour, like the caterpillar known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the pear&ndash;leech (<i>Selandria Æthiops</i>), only some
hundreds of sizes bigger, that loathsome reptile
sneaked in through and crouched in a corner,
while Cradock thought that he smelled something
very nasty, as he smoked a pipe of the traderʼs
tobacco, before turning into his locker.</p>

<p>He had cut himself a good broad coving from
the inside of the mowana&ndash;tree, about three feet
from the ground, fitted up with a flap and a pillow&ndash;place,
and strewn with fresh plantain&ndash;leaves. Across
the niche he had fastened a new mosquito net,
borrowed from his friend the trader, whose goods
he began to look upon now as placed under his
trusteeship. And in that rude couch he slept as
snugly, after a hard dayʼs work, as the pupa does
of the goat moth, or of the giant sirex. Under
his feet was Wenaʼs hole, wherein she crouched
like a rabbit, and pricked her ears every now and
then, and barked if ever the wind moaned. <i>Fortunatos
nimium</i>; there was nobody to rogue them.</p>

<p>And yet no sooner was Craddy asleep, upon the
night I am telling of, than that dirty bottle&ndash;green
snake, flat&ndash;headed, and with a yearʼs supply of
venom in its tooth&ndash;bag, came wriggling on its
dappled belly around the hollow ring, while the
dying embers of the fire&mdash;for the night was rather
chilly and wet, and Cradock had cooked some fish&mdash;showed
the mean sneak, poking its head up,
feeling the temper of the time, ready to wriggle
to anything. Then it came to the bedposts of
Cradockʼs couch, which he had cut, in a dry sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
humour, from the soft baobab wood. It lifted its
head, and heard him snoring, and tapped its tail,
and listened again. Very likely it was warm up
there, and the snake was a little chilly, in this
depth of the winter. So without any evil forethought&mdash;for
I must be just, even to a snake&mdash;though
ready to bite, at a move or a turn, of the
animal known as “man,” up went that little serpent,
cleverly and elegantly, as on a Bohemian
vase. Cradock would have died in two hours after
that snake had bitten him. But before that lissom
coil of death had got all its tail off the ground,
fangs as keen as its own, though not poisonous, had
it by the nape of the neck. Wena knew a snake
by this time, and could treat them aright. She
gave the devilish miscreant not a chance to twist
upon her, but tore him from his belly&ndash;hold, and
walked pleasantly to the fire, and with a spit of
execration threw him into it, and ran back, and
then ran to again, and barked at the noise he made
in fizzing. Therewith Cradock awoke, and got
out of bed, and saw the past danger, and coaxed
the little dog, and kissed her, and talked to her
about Amy, whose name she knew quite as well as
her own.</p>

<p>After all his works were finished, and when he
hardly knew what great public improvement he
should next attempt, Cradock received visitors, unexpected
and unfashionable. In fact, they were all stark
naked; although that proves very little. Climbing
his tree, one beautiful morning, he saw four or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
little marks on the sea, as of so many housemaidsʼ
thumbs, when the cheek of the grate has been
polished. Staring thereat with all his eyes&mdash;as we
loosely express it&mdash;he found that the thumb&ndash;marks
got bigger and bigger, until they became long
canoes, paddling, like good ones, towards him.</p>

<p>This was not not by any means the sort of
thing he had bargained for; and he became, to state
the matter mildly, most decidedly nervous. He
saw that there were invading him five great
double canoes, each containing ten or twelve men;
and he had no gun, nor a pinch of powder. Very
likely they were cannibals, and would roast him
slowly, to brown him nicely, and then serve up
Wena for garnish. He shook so up there among
the rough branches&mdash;for he did not so very much
mind, being killed, but he could not bear to be
eaten&mdash;that Wena began to howl down below, and
he was obliged to come down to quiet her.</p>

<p>Then he tied up black Wena, and muzzled her,
to her immense indignation, with a capistrum of
mowana bark, which quite foreclosed her own, and
then he crept warily through the woods to observe
his black brethrenʼs proceedings. They were very
near the shore by this time, and making straight
for the traderʼs hut, of which they had doubtless
received some account. Cradock felt his courage
rising, and therewith some indignation, for he
knew that the goods could not be theirs, and by
this time he considered himself in commission as
supercargo. So he resolved to save the store from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pillage, if it were possible, even at the risk of his
life.</p>

<p>For this purpose he lay down in a hollow place
by the water&ndash;side, where he could just see over the
tide&ndash;bank without much fear of discovery, at least,
till the robbers had passed the shed, which, of
course, was their principal object. It was evidently
a king of men who stood at the prow of the foremost
canoe, with a javelin in his great black hand,
poised and ready for casting. His apparel consisted
of two great ear&ndash;drops, two rings upon his
right wrist, and one below either knee; also a
chain of teeth was dangling down his brawny
bosom. He was painted red, and polished highly,
which had to be done every morning; and he
looked as dignified and more powerful than a don
or dean. One man in each boat was painted and
polished&mdash;doubtless the sign of high rank and great
birth.</p>

<p>When the bottom of the double canoe grated
upon the beach, the negro king flung back his
strong arm, and cast at the shed his javelin. It
passed through the roof and buried itself in the
body of the fetich, which swung horribly to and
fro, while the crinoline moved round it. Hereupon
a yell arose from the invading flotilla, and
every man trembled, waiting to see what would
come of such an impiety. Finding that nothing
at all ensued, for Cradock had not the presence of
mind to advance at the moment, they gave another
yell and landed, washing a great deal of red from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their legs. But the king was brought ashore, dry
and bright, sitting on some officers’ shoulders. Then
they came up the bank, without any order, but
each with his javelin ready, and his eyes intent on
the idol. How Cradock longed for a piece of
packthread, to have set the dried codfish dancing!</p>

<p>At last they came quite up to the shed, and held
a consultation, in which it seemed the better
counsel to allow the god, who looked ever so much
more awful now they were near him, a certain
time to vindicate himself, if he possessed the power
to do so. Cradock was watching them closely,
through a tussock of long sea&ndash;grass, and, in spite
of their powerful frames and elastic carriage,
he began to despise them in the wholesale
Britannic manner. They should not steal <i>his</i>
property, that he was quite resolved upon, although
there were fifty of them. They were so near to
him now that he could see their great white teeth,
and hear them snapping as they talked.</p>

<p>When the time allowed, which their Agamemnon
was telling upon his fingers, had quite expired,
and Olympian Jove had sent as yet no lightnings,
the king, who was clearly in front of his age, cast
another javelin through the frame of crinoline, and
leaped boldly, like Patroclus, following his dart.
Suddenly he fell back, howling and yelling, cured
for ever of scepticism, and with both his great eyes
quite slewed up, and all his virtue in his heels.
Away went every nigger, drowning the royal
screams with their own, pell&ndash;mell down the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
anyhow, only caring to cut hawser. Words like
these came back to Cradock, as they rolled over
one another&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mbongo, pongo; warakai, urelwäi;” which
mean, as interpreted afterwards by the Yankee
trader,</p>

<p>“He is a God, a great God; he maketh rain,
yea, very great rain!”</p>

<p>Headlong they tumbled into their boats, not
stopping to carry the king even, for which he
kicked them heartily, as soon as he got on board,
and every son of a woman of them plied his knotted
arms at the paddle, as if grim Death was behind
him.</p>

<p>Cradock laughed so heartily, that he rolled over
with the hydropult on him, and threw his heels up
in the air, and if they had not yelled so, they
would have been sure to hear him. Very skilfully
he had brought the nose of that noble engine to
bear full upon the royal countenance, and the jet
of water from the little stream passed through the
ribs of the fetich. That god had asserted himself
to such purpose, that henceforth you might hang
him with beads, and give him a wig of tobacco,
and no black man would dare to look at them.</p>

<p>Cradock Nowell felt almost too proud of his
mighty volunteer movement, and began to think
more than ever that the whole of the island was
his. These things show, more than anything else
can, his return to human reason; for of the rational
human being&mdash;as discovered ordinarily&mdash;the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
first instinct and ambition is the ownership of a
peculium. What man cannot sympathize with that
feeling who has got three fields and six children?
Therefore when a beautiful schooner, of the true
American rig, which made such lagging neddies of
our yachts a few years since, came into view one
afternoon, and fetched up, with the sails all shaking
in the wind, abreast of the shed, ere sun&ndash;down, Cradock
felt like the owner of a house who sees a man
at his gate. Then he came down quietly with
Wena, and sat upon a barrel, with a pipe of
Cavendish in his mouth, and Wena crouched, like
a chrysalis, between his pumpkinʼd feet.</p>

<p>Even the Yankee, who had not been surprised at
any incident of life since his nurse dropped him
down an oil&ndash;well, when he was two years old,
even he experienced some sensation, when he saw
a white man sitting and smoking upon his barrel of
knowingest notions, with a black dog at his feet.
But Recklesome Young was not the man to be
long taken aback.</p>

<p>“Darn me, but yoo are a cool hand. Britisher,
for ten dollars. Never see none like ‘em, I
donʼt.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” answered Cradock, “I am
an Englishman. Very much at your service.
What is your business upon my island?”</p>

<p>“Waal,” said the Yankee, turning round to the
four men who had rowed him ashore; “Zebedee,
this is just what I likes, and no mistark about it.
One of them old islanders come to dispute possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
And perhaps a cannon up the hill, and a
company of sojers. Ainʼt it good, Zeb, ainʼt it?
Lor, how I do love them!”</p>

<p>“Now, donʼt be too premature,” said Cradock,
“it is the fault of your nation, as the opposite is
ours.”</p>

<p>“Darned well said, young Britisher, give us
your hand’ upon it; for, arter all, I likes yoo.”</p>

<p>Cradock shook hands with him heartily, for
there was something in the manʼs face and manner,
when you let his chaff drift by, which an Englishman
recognises, as kindly, strong, and sincere, although
now and then contemptuous. The contempt
alone is not genuine, but assumed to meet
ours or anybodyʼs. The active, for fear of the
passive voice.</p>

<p>“You are welcome to all the island,” said Cradock,
“and all my improvements, if you will only
take me home again. The whole of it belongs to
me, no doubt; but I will make it all over to you,
for a passage to Southampton.”</p>

<p>“Canʼt take you that way, young Boss, and
donʼt want your legal writings. How come you
here, to begin with?”</p>

<p>Cradock told him all his story, while the men
were busy; and the keen American saw at once
that every word was true.</p>

<p>“Strikes me,” he said, with a serious drawl,
which the fun in his eyes contradicted, “that yoo,
after the way of the British, have made a trifle
free, young man, with some of my goods and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
chattels he&ndash;ar; and even yoor encro&ndash;aching country
canʼt prove tittle to them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Cradock; “and I will pay you,
if I have not done so already. I will give you the
thing which has saved the whole from plunder, and
perhaps fire afterwards.”</p>

<p>Then he fetched the little machine, which the
Yankee recognised at once as an American invention,
and he laughed till his yellow cheeks were
reeking at the description of the “darned naygursʼ
retreat.”</p>

<p>“Rip me up, young man,” he said, “but yooʼd
be a credit to us aʼmost. Darnʼd if I thought as
any Britisher wud ever be up to so cute a dodge.
Shake hands agin, young chap, I likes yoo. And
yooʼve airned your ticket anywhor, and a hunderd
dollars to back of it. Weʼll take yoo to the centre
of the univarsal world, and make yoo open your
eyes a bit. Ship aboard of us for Noo Yerk, and
if that donʼt make a man of yoo, call me small
pumpkins arterwards.”</p>

<p>“But I want to get to England,” said Cradock,
looking very black; “and I have no money for
passage from New York to Southampton.”</p>

<p>“Thur now, yoo be all over a Britisher agin,
and reck&ndash;wirin enlightʼment. Yoo allays spies out
fifty raisons agin a thin’ smarter than one in itʼs
favior. Harken, now, Iʼll have yoo sot down in
the docks of Suthanton, free, and with fifty dollars
to trade upon, sure as my name is Recklesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Young. Thur, now! Bet, I donʼt, will yoo, and
pay me out o’ my spisshy?”</p>

<p>Not to dwell too long upon these little side&ndash;paths,
it is enough to record that Captain Recklesome
Young, of New York, and the schooner, <i>Donʼt you
wish you may catch me</i>, made sail two days afterwards,
with half of his best cabin allotted to Cradock
and to Wena. And, keen as he was to the
shave of a girlʼs lip, in striking a contract or
cutting it, upon a large scale, he came down as
nobly as the angels on Jacobʼs ladder. No English
duke or prince of the blood could or would have
behaved to Cradock more grandly than Recklesome
Young did, when once he understood him.
In such things the Yankees are far ahead of us.
Keen as they are, and for that same reason, they
have far more trust than we have, in large and
good human nature. Of the best of them I have
heard many a true tale, such as I never could hope
to hear of our noblest London merchants. Proofs
of grand faith, and Godlike confidence in a man
once approved, which enlarge the heart of him
who hears them, and makes him hate small satire.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="p2">Bob Garnet, with his trowel, and box, and
net, and many other impediments, was going along
very merrily, in a quiet path of the Forest, thinking
sometimes of Amy and her fundamental errors,
and sometimes of Eoa, and the way she could
catch a butterfly, but for the most part busy with
the display of life around him, and the prospects
of a great boring family, which he had found in a
willow&ndash;tree. Suddenly, near the stag&ndash;headed oak,
he chanced upon Miss Nowell, tripping along the
footpath lightly, smiling and blushing rosily, and
oh! so surprised to see him! She darted aside,
like a trout at a shadow, then, finding it too late
for that game, she tried to pass him rapidly, with
her long eyelashes drooping.</p>

<p>“Oh, please to stop a minute, if you can spare
the time,” said Bob; “what have I done to offend
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>She stopped in a moment at his voice, and lifted
her radiant eyes to him, and shyly tried to cloud
away the sparkling night of hair, through which
her white and slender throat gleamed like the
Milky Way. The sprays of the wood and the
winds of May had romped with her glorious
tresses; and now she had been lectured so, that
she doubted her right to exhibit her hair.</p>

<p>“Miss Nowell,” said Bob, as she had not answered,
but only been thinking about him, “only
please to stop and tell me what I have done to
offend you; and you do love beetles so&mdash;and you
never saw such beauties&mdash;what have I done to
offend you?”</p>

<p>An English maiden would have said, “Oh,
nothing at all, Mr. Garnet;” and then swept on,
with her crinoline embracing a thousand brambles.</p>

<p>But Eoa stood just where she was, with her
bright lips pouting slightly, and her gaze absorbed
by a tuft of moss.</p>

<p>“Only because you are not at all good&ndash;natured
to me, Bob. But it doesnʼt make much difference.”</p>

<p>Then she turned away from him, and began to
sing a little song, and then called, “Amy, Amy!”</p>

<p>“Donʼt call Amy. I donʼt want her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon, Iʼm sure I rather
thought you did.”</p>

<p>“Eoa,” said Bob; and she looked at him, and
the tears were in her eyes. And then she whispered,
“Yes, Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“You have got on the very prettiest dress I ever
saw in all my life.”</p>

<p>Here Bob was alarmed at his own audacity, and
durst not watch the effect of his speech.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that all?” she answered. “But I am
very glad indeed that you like&mdash;my frock, Bob.”
Here she looked down at it, with much interest.</p>

<p>“And, to tell you the truth,” continued he,
“I think, if you will please not to be offended,
that you look very well in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I am very well. I wish I was ill,
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Now, I donʼt mean that. What I mean is,
very nice.”</p>

<p>“Well, I always try to be nice. But how can
I, out butterfly&ndash;hunting?”</p>

<p>“Now, you wonʼt understand me. You are as
bad as a weevil that wonʼt take chloroform. What
I mean is, very pretty.”</p>

<p>“I donʼt know anything about that,” said Eoa,
drawing back; “and I donʼt see that you have
any right even to talk about it. Oh, there goes a
lovely butterfly!”</p>

<p>“Where, where? What eyes you have got!
I do wish I was married to you. What a collection
we would have! And you would never let
my traps off. I am sure that you are a great deal
better and prettier than Amy. And I like you
more than anybody I have ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Do you, Bob? Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p>She fixed her large eyes upon his; and in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
moment her beauty went to the bottom of his
heart. It changed him from a boy to a man,
from play to passion, from dreams to thought.
And happy for him that it was so, with the trouble
impending over him.</p>

<p>She saw the change; herself too young, too
pure (in spite of all the evil that ever had drifted
by her) to know or ask what it meant. She only
felt that Bob liked her now better than he liked
Amy. She had no idea of the deep anticipation
of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Eoa, wonʼt you answer me?” He had been
talking some nonsense. “Why are you crying so
dreadfully? Do you hate me so much as all
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, Bob. I am sure I donʼt hate you
at all. I only wish I did. No, I donʼt, Bob. I
am so glad that I donʼt. I donʼt care a quarter so
much, Bob, for all the rest of the world put
together.”</p>

<p>“Then only look up at me, Eoa. I canʼt tell
what I am saying. Only look up. You are so
nice. And you have got such eyes.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” said Eoa, throwing all their splendour
on him; “oh, I am so glad you like them.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that you could give me just a
sort of a kiss, Eoa? People always do, you know.
And, indeed, I feel that you ought.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely know what is right, Bob, after all
the things they have told me. But now, you
know, you must guide me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then, Iʼll tell you what. Just let me give
you one. The leaves are coming out so.”</p>

<p>“Well, thatʼs a different thing,” said Eoa.
“Amy canʼt see us, can she?”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell was very angry when his
niece came home, and told him, with an air of
triumph, all that Bob had said to her.</p>

<p>“That butterfly&ndash;hunting boy, Eoa! To think
of his presuming so! A mere boy! A boy like
that!”</p>

<p>“Thatʼs the very thing, uncle. Perhaps if he
had been a girl, you know, I should not have liked
him half so much. And as for his hunting butterflies,
I like him all the better for that. And
weʼll hunt them all day long.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Uncle Cradock, smiling at
the young girlʼs earnestness in spite of all his
wrath; “that is your idea of married life then, is
it? But I never will allow it, Eoa: he is not
your equal.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, uncle. He is my superior in
every possible way.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely so, in the matter of birth; nor yet,
my child, I fear, in a pecuniary sense.”</p>

<p>“For both of those I donʼt care two pice. You
know it is all very nice, Uncle Cradock, to live in
large rooms, where you can put three chairs
together, and jump over them all without knocking
your head, and to have beautiful books, and
prawns for breakfast, and flowers all the year
round; and to be able to scold people without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
their daring to answer. But I could do without
all that very well, but I never could do without
Bob.”</p>

<p>“I fear you must, indeed, my dear. As other
people have had to do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I donʼt see why, unless God takes him;
and then He should take me too. And, indeed, I
had better tell you once for all, Uncle Cradock,
that I do not mean to try. It would be so shabby
of me, after what I told him just now, and after
his saving my life; and you yourself said yesterday
that no Nowell had ever been shabby. You
have been very kind to me and good, and I love
you very much, I am sure. But in spite of all
that, I wish you clearly to understand, Uncle
Cradock, that if you try any nonsense with me,
I shall get my darling fatherʼs money, and go and
live away from you.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the old man, smiling at the
manner and tone of her menace, which she delivered
as if her departure must at least annihilate
him, “you are laying your plans too rapidly.
You are not seventeen until next July; and you
cannot touch your poor fatherʼs money until you
are twenty&ndash;one.”</p>

<p>“I donʼt care,” she replied; “he is sure to
have been right about it. But I will tell you
another thing. Everybody says that I could earn
ten thousand a year as an opera&ndash;dancer in London.
And I should like it very much,&mdash;that is to say,
if Bob did. And I would not think of changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
my name, as I have heard that most of them do.
I should be ‘Miss Eoa Nowell, the celebrated
dancer.’”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” said Sir Cradock. “My only
brotherʼs only child! I will not trouble you about
him, dear. Only I beg you to consider.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I will, Uncle Cradock, I have been
considering ever since how long it must be till I
marry him. Now give me a kiss, dear, and I wonʼt
dance, except for your amusement. And I donʼt
think I can dance for a long time, after what I
have been told about poor Cousin Cradock. I am
sure he was very nice, uncle, from what everybody
says of him, and I am almost certain that you behaved
very badly to him.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you are allowed to say what you like,
because nobody can stop you. But your own good
feeling should make you spare me the pain of that
sad subject.”</p>

<p>“Not if you deserve the pain for having been
hard&ndash;hearted. And much you cared for my pain,
when you spoke of Bob so. Besides, you are quite
sure to hear of it; and it had better come from
me, dear uncle, who am so considerate.”</p>

<p>“Something new? What is it, my child? I
can bear almost anything now.”</p>

<p>“It is that some vile wretches are trying to get
what they call a warrant against him, and so to
put him in jail.”</p>

<p>“Put him in jail? My unfortunate son! What
more has he been doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. And I donʼt believe that he
ever did any harm. But what the brutes say is
that he did that terrible thing on purpose. Oh,
uncle, donʼt look at me like that. How I wish I
had never told you!”</p>

<p>Poor Sir Cradockʼs mind was not so clear and
strong as it had been, although the rumours scattered
by Georgie were shameful exaggerations.
The habit of brooding over his grief, whenever he
was alone&mdash;a habit more and more indulged, as it
became a morbid pleasure&mdash;the loss moreover of
his accustomed exercise, for he never would go out
riding now, having no son to ride with him; these,
and the ever&ndash;present dread of some inevitable inquiry,
began to disturb, though not destroy, the
delicate fibres of reason, which had not too much
room in his brain.</p>

<p>He fell into the depths of an easy&ndash;chair, and
wondered what it was he had heard. The lids of
his mindʼs eye had taken a blink, as will happen
sometimes to old people, and to young ones too for
that matter; neither was it the first time this thing
had befallen him.</p>

<p>Then Eoa told him again what it was, because
he made her tell it; and again it shocked him
dreadfully; but that time he remembered it.</p>

<p>“And I have no doubt,” continued his niece,
with bright tears on her cheeks, “that Mrs. Corklemore
herself is at the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>“Georgie! What, my niece Georgie!”</p>

<p>“She is not your niece, Uncle Cradock. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
your niece, and nobody else; and you had better
not think of wronging me. If you call her your
niece any more, I know I will never call you my
uncle. Nasty limy slimy thing! If you would only
give me leave to choke her!”</p>

<p>“My darling child,” cried her uncle, who loved
her the more (though he knew it not) for siding
with his son so, “you are so very hot and hasty.
I am sure Mrs. Corklemore speaks of you with the
warmest pity and affection.”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you why she does, Uncle Crad?
Shall I tell you in plain English? Most likely you
will be shocked, you know.”</p>

<p>“My dear, I am so used to you, that I am never
shocked now at anything.”</p>

<p>“Then it is because she is <i>such a jolly liar</i>.”</p>

<p>“Eoa, I really must send you to a ‘nice institution
for young ladies.’ You get worse and
worse.”</p>

<p>“If you do, Iʼll jump over the wall the first
night, and Bob shall come to catch me. But now
without any nonsense, uncle, for you do talk a
good deal of nonsense, will you promise me one
thing?”</p>

<p>“A dozen, if you like, my darling. Anything
in reason. You did look so like your poor father
then.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad of that. But it is not a
thing of reason, uncle; it is simply a thing of
justice. Now will you promise solemnly to send
away Mrs. Corklemore, and never speak to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
again, if she vows that she knows nothing of this,
and if I prove from her own handwriting that it is
her plot altogether, and also another plot against
us, every bit as bad, if not worse?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Eoa, I will promise you that, as
solemnly as you please. What a deluded child
you are!”</p>

<p>“Am I? Now let her come in, and deny it.
Thatʼs the first part of the business.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, she ran to fetch
Mrs. Corklemore, whom she well knew where to
find, that time of the afternoon. Dear Georgie had
just had her cup of tea with the darling Flore, in
her private audience&ndash;chamber&mdash;”oratory” she
called it, though all her few prayers were public;
and now she was meditating what dress she should
wear at dinner. Those dinners were so dreadfully
dull, unless she could put Eoa into a vehement
passion&mdash;which was not very hard to do&mdash;and so
exhibit her in a pleasant light before the serving&ndash;men.
Yet, strange to say, although the young
lady observed little moderation, when she was
baited thus, and sunk irony in invective, the sympathies
of the audience were far more often on her
side than on that of the soft tormentor.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Sugar&ndash;plums,” said Eoa, who often
addressed her so, “we want you down&ndash;stairs, if
you please, for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Tum, pease, Oh Ah,” cried little Flore, running
up; “pease tum, and tell Fore a tory.”</p>

<p>“Canʼt now, you good little child. And your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mamma tells stories so cleverly, oh, so very cleverly,
it quite takes away oneʼs breath.”</p>

<p>“Iʼll have my change out of you at dinner&ndash;time,”
said Georgie to herself most viciously, as she
followed down the passage.</p>

<p>Eoa led her along at a pace which made her
breath quite short, for she was not wont to hurry
so, and she dropped right gladly into the chair
which Sir Cradock politely set for her. Then, as
he himself sat down, facing her with a heavy sigh,
Georgie felt rather uncomfortable. She was not
quite ready for the crisis, but feared that it was
coming. And she saw at a glimpse that her hated
foe, “Never&ndash;spot&ndash;the&ndash;dust,” was quite ready, burning
indeed to begin, only wanting to make the
most of it. Thereupon Mrs. Corklemore, knowing
the value of the weather&ndash;gage, and being unable
to bear a slow silence, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Something has occurred, I see, to one of you
two dear ones. Oh, Uncle Cradock, what can I do
to prove the depth of my regard for you? Or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To be sure, <i>the depth</i> of your regard,” Eoa interrupted.</p>

<p>“Or is it for you, you poor wild thing? We all
make such allowance for you, because of your
great disadvantages. If you have done anything
very wrong indeed, poor darling, anything which
hard people would call not only thoughtless but
unprincipled, I can feel for you so truly, because
of your hot temperament and most unhappy circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“You had better not go too far!” cried Eoa,
grinding her little teeth.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! I see, dear, it is nothing so
very disgraceful after all, because it has nothing
to do with you, or you would not smile so prettily.
You take it so lightly, it must be something about
dear Uncle Cradock. Oh, Uncle Cradock, tell me
all about it; my whole heart will be with you.”</p>

<p>“Black&ndash;spangled hen has broken her eggs.
Nothing more,” said Eoa. “De&ndash;ar, oh we do love
you so!” She made two syllables of that word, as
Mrs. Corklemore used to do, in her many gushing
moments. Georgie looked at Eoa with wonder.
She had stupidly thought her a stupid.</p>

<p>Then Sir Cradock Nowell rose, in a stately
manner, to put an end to all this little nonsense.</p>

<p>“My niece, Eoa, declares, Mrs. Corklemore, that
you, in some underhand manner, have promoted
a horrible charge against my poor son Cradock, a
charge which no person in any way connected with
our family should ever dare to utter, even if he or
she believed its justice, far less dare to promulgate,
and even force into the courts of law. Is this so,
or is it not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Cradock, how can you speak so?
What charge should I ever dream of?”</p>

<p>“See how her hands are trembling, and how
white her lips are; not with telling black lies,
Uncle Cradock, but with being found out.”</p>

<p>“Eoa, have the kindness not to interrupt
again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Uncle Cradock; I wonʼt, unless
you make me.”</p>

<p>“Then, as I understand, madam, you deny entirely
the truth of this accusation?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, most emphatically. What can
you all be dreaming about?”</p>

<p>“Now, Eoa, it is your turn to establish what you
have said.”</p>

<p>“I canʼt establish anything, though I know it,
Uncle Cradock.”</p>

<p>“<i>Know</i> it indeed, you poor wild nautch&ndash;girl!
<i>Dreamed</i> it you mean, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” continued Eoa, not even looking at
her, but bending her fingers in a manner which
Georgie quite understood, “that I cannot prove
anything, Uncle Cradock, without your permission.
But here I have a letter, with the seal
unbroken, and which I promised some one not to
open without her leave, and now she has given me
leave to open it with your consent and in the
presence of the writer. Why, how pale you are,
Mrs. Corklemore!”</p>

<p>“My Heavens! And this is England! Stealing
letters, and forging them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Which of the two do you mean, madam?”
asked Sir Cradock, looking at her in his old magisterial
manner, after examining the envelope;
“either involves a heavy charge against a member
of my family. Is this letter yours, or not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” replied Georgie, after a momentʼs
debate, for if she called it a forgery, it must of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
course be opened; “have the kindness to give me
my property. I thought there was among well&ndash;bred
people a delicacy as to scrutinizing even the
directions of one anotherʼs letters.”</p>

<p>“So there is, madam; you are quite right&mdash;except,
indeed, under circumstances altogether exceptional,
and of which this is one. Now for your
own exculpation, and to prove that my niece
deserves heavy punishment (which I will take
care to inflict), allow me to open this letter. I see
it is merely a business letter, or I would not ask
even that; although you have so often assured me
that you have no secret in the world from me.
You can have nothing confidential to say to
‘Simon Chope, Esq.;’ and if you had, it should
remain sacred and secure with me, unless it involved
the life and honour of my son. Shall I
open this letter?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, Sir Cradock Nowell. How dare
you to think of such a thing, so mean, so low, so
prying?”</p>

<p>“After those words, madam, you cannot continue
to be a guest of mine; or be ever received
in this house again, unless you prove that I have
wronged you, by allowing me to send for your
husband, and to place this letter in his hands,
before you have in any way communicated with
him.”</p>

<p>“Give me my letter, Sir Cradock Nowell,
unless your niece inherits the thieving art from
you. As for you, wretched little Dacoit,” here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
she bent upon Eoa flashing eyes quite pale from
wrath, for sweet Georgie had her temper, “bitterly
you shall rue the day when you presumed to
match yourself with me. You would like to do a
little murder, I see. No doubt it runs in the
family; and the Thugs and Dacoits are first
cousins, of course.”</p>

<p>Never had Eoa fought so desperate a battle
with herself, as now to keep her hands off Georgie.
Without looking at her again, she very wisely ran
away, for it was the only chance of abstaining.
Mrs. Corklemore laughed aloud; then she took
the letter, which the old man had placed upon the
table, and said to him, with a kind look of pity:</p>

<p>“What a fuss you have made about nothing!
It is only a question upon the meaning of a clause
in my marriage&ndash;settlement; but I do not choose
to have my business affairs exposed, even to my
husband. Now do you believe me, Uncle Cradock?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot say that I do, madam. And it
does not matter whether I do or not. You have
used language about my family which I can never
forget. A carriage will be at your service at any
moment you please.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for your hospitable hint. You will
soon find your mistake, I think, in having made
me your enemy; though your rudeness is partly
excused, no doubt, by your growing hallucinations.
Farewell for the present, poor dear Uncle
Cradock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>With these words, Mrs. Corklemore made him
an elegant curtsey, and swept away from the
room, without even the glisten of a tear to mar
her gallant bearing, although she had been so outraged.
But when she got little Floreʼs head on
her lap, she cried over it very vehemently, and
felt the depth of her injury.</p>

<p>When she had closed the door behind her (not
with any vulgar bang, but firmly and significantly),
the master of the house walked over to a panelled
mirror, and inspected himself uncomfortably. It
was a piece of ancient glass, purchased from an
Italian chapel by some former Cradock Nowell,
and bearing a mystic name and fame among the
maids who dusted it. By them it was supposed to
have a weird prophetic power, partly, no doubt,
from its deep dark lustre, and partly because it
was circular, and ever so slightly, and quite imperceptibly,
concave. As upon so broad a surface no
concavity could be, in the early ages of mechanism,
made absolutely true&mdash;and for that matter it cannot
be done <i>ad unguem</i>, even now&mdash;there were, of
course, many founts of error in this Italian mirror.
Nevertheless, all young ladies who ever beheld it
were charmed with it, so sweetly deeply beautiful,
like Galatea watching herself and finding Polypheme
over her shoulder, in the glass of the blue
Sicilian sea.</p>

<p>To this glass Sir Cradock Nowell went to examine
his faded eyes, time&ndash;worn, trouble&ndash;worn,
stranded by the ebbing of the brain. He knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
too well what Mrs. Corklemore meant by her last
thrust; and the word “hallucination” happened,
through a great lawsuit then in progress, to be invested
with an especial prominence and significance.
While he was sadly gazing into the convergence of
grey light, and feebly reassuring himself, yet like
his image wavering, a heavy step was heard behind
him, and beside his flowing silvery locks appeared
the close&ndash;cropped massive brow and the gloomy
eyes of Bull Garnet.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="p2">As the brothers confronted one another, the
legitimate and the base&ndash;born, the man of tact and
the man of force, the luxurious and the labourer,
strangely unlike in many respects, more strangely
alike in others; each felt kindly and tenderly, yet
timidly, for the other.</p>

<p>The old man thought of the lying wrong inflicted
upon the stronger one by their common
father; the other felt the worse wrong&mdash;if possible&mdash;done
by himself to his brother. The measure
of such things is not for us. God knows, and
visits, and forgives them.</p>

<p>Even by the failing light&mdash;for the sun was westering,
and a cloud flowed over him&mdash;each could see
that the otherʼs face was not as it should be, that
the flight of weeks was drawing age on, more than
the lapse of years should.</p>

<p>“Garnet, you do a great deal too much. I
shall recall my urgent request, if you look so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
harassed and haggard. Take a holiday now for a
month, before the midsummer rents fall due. I
will try to do without you; though I may want
you any day.”</p>

<p>“I will do nothing of the sort; work is needful
for me&mdash;without it I should die. But you also
look very unwell. You must not attempt to prescribe
for me.”</p>

<p>“I have not been happy lately. By&ndash;and&ndash;by
things will be better. What is your impression of
Mrs. Nowell Corklemore?”</p>

<p>“That she is an arrant hypocrite, unscrupulous,
foul, and deadly.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is plain speaking; by no means
complimentary. Poor Georgie, I hope you misjudge
her, as she says bad people do. But for the
present she is gone. There has been a great fight,
all along, between her and Eoa; they could not
bear one another. And now my niece has discovered
a thing which brings me to her side in the
matter, for she at least is genuine.”</p>

<p>“That she is indeed, and genuinely passionate;
you may trust her with anything. She has been
very rude indeed to me; and yet I like her wonderfully.
What has she discovered?”</p>

<p>“That Mrs. Corklemore is at the bottom of this
horrible application for a warrant against my
son.”</p>

<p>“I can well believe it. It struck me in a moment;
though I cannot see her object. I never
understand plotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I, Garnet; I only know she has
made me insult the dearest friend I had on
earth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Rosedew; I heard of it, and wondered
at your weakness. But it did not become
me to interfere.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not: most certainly not. You could
not expect me to bear it. And the Rosedews never
liked you.”</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with it. Very probably
they are right; for I do not like myself.
And you will not dislike, but hate me, when you
know what I have to say.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnetʼs mind was now made up. For
months he had been thinking, forecasting, doubting,
wavering&mdash;a condition of mind so strange to
him, so adrift from all his landmarks, that this
alone, without sense of guilt, must have kept him
in wretchedness.</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell only said, “Keep it for
another time. I cannot bear any more excitement;
I have had so much to&ndash;day.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet looked at him sorrowfully. He
could not bear to see his brother beaten so by
trouble, and to feel his own hard hand in it.</p>

<p>“Donʼt you know what they say of me? Oh,
you know what they say of me; and nothing of
the kind in the family!” The old man seemed to
prove that there was, by the vague flashing of his
eyes: “Garnet, you are my brother; after all, you
are my brother. And they say I am going mad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and I know they will try to shut me up, without a
horse, or a book, or a boy to brush my trousers. Oh,
Garnet, you have been bitterly wronged, shamefully
wronged, detestably; but you will not let
your own brother&mdash;brother, who has no sons now
to protect him,&mdash;be shut up, and made nothing of?
Bull Garnet, promise me this, although we have so
wronged you.”</p>

<p>Garnet knew not what to do. Even he was
taken aback, shocked by this sudden outburst,
which partly proved what it denied. And this
altogether changed the form of the confession he
was come to make&mdash;and changed it for the
better.</p>

<p>“My brother”&mdash;it was the first time he had ever
so addressed him; not from diffidence, but from
pride&mdash;”my brother, let us look at things, if possible,
as God made them. I have been injured no
doubt, and so my mother was; blasted, both of us,
for life, according to the little ideas of this creeping
world. In many cases, the thief is the rogue; in
even more, the robbed one is the only villain. Now
can you take the large view of things which is
forced upon us outsiders when we dare to think at
all?”</p>

<p>“I cannot think now of such abstract things.
My mind is astray with trouble. Did I ever tell
you your motherʼs words, when she came here ten
or twelve years ago, and demanded a share of the
property? Not for her own sake, but for yours, to
get you into some business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“No, I never heard of it. How it must have
hurt her!” Bull Garnet was astonished; because
it had long been understood that his mother
should not be spoken of.</p>

<p>“And me as well. I gave her a cheque for a
liberal sum, as I thought. She tore it, and threw
it at me. What more could I do? Did I deserve
her curse, Garnet? Is all this trouble
come upon me because I did not obey her?”</p>

<p>“I believe that you meant to do exactly what
was right.”</p>

<p>“I hope&mdash;I believe, I did. And see how
wrong she was in one part of her prediction.
She said that I and my father also should be
punished through you, through you, her only
son. What a mistake that has proved! You,
who are my right arm and brain; my only hope
and comfort!”</p>

<p>The old man came up, and looked with the
deepest trust and admiration at his unacknowledged
brother. A few months ago, Bull Garnet
would have taken such a look as his truest and
best revenge for the cruel wrong to his mother.
But now he fell away from it, and muttered
something, in a manner quite unlike his own.
His mind was made up, he was come to tell all;
but how could he do it now, and wrench the old
manʼs latest hope away?</p>

<p>Then suddenly he remembered, or knew from
his own feelings, that an old manʼs last hope in
earthly matters should rest upon no friend or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
brother, not even upon a wife, but upon his own
begotten, his successors in the world. And what
he had to say, while tearing all reliance from himself,
would replace it where it should be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Cradock Nowell, thinking that
Garnet was too grateful for a few kind words, followed
him, and placed his slender tremulous and
pure&ndash;bred hand in the useful cross&ndash;bred palm which
had sent Mr. Jupp down the coal&ndash;shaft.</p>

<p>“Bull, you are my very best friend. After all,
we are brothers. Promise to defend me.”</p>

<p>But Garnet only withdrew his hand, and sighed,
and could not look at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, even you believe it; I see you do!
It must be true. God have mercy upon me!”</p>

<p>“Cradock, it is a cursed lie; you must not dwell
upon it. Such thoughts are spawn of madness;
turn to another subject. Just tell me what is the
greatest thing one man can do to another?”</p>

<p>“To love him, I suppose, Garnet. But I donʼt
care much for that sort of thing, since I lost my
children.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a grand thing to love; but far
grander to forgive.”</p>

<p>“Is it? I am glad to hear it. I always could
forgive.”</p>

<p>“Little things, you mean, no doubt. Slights
and slurs&mdash;and so forth?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and great things also. But I am not
what I was, Bull. You know what I have been
through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Can you forgive as deep a wrong as one man
ever did to another?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say. I am sure I donʼt know.
What makes you look at me like that?”</p>

<p>“Because I shot your son Clayton; and because
I did it on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Viley! my boy Viley! Oh, I had forgotten.
What a stupid thing of me! I thought he was
dead somehow. Now, I will open the door for
him, because his hands are full. And let him put
his game on the table&mdash;never mind the papers&mdash;he
always likes me to see it. Oh, Viley, how
long you have been away! What a bag you must
have made! Come in, my boy; come in.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnetʼs heart cleaved to his side, as the
old man opened the door, and looked, with the
leaping joy of a fatherʼs love, for his pet, his beloved,
his treasured one. But nothing except cold
air came in.</p>

<p>“The passage is empty. Perhaps he is waiting,
because his boots are dirty. Tell him not to think
twice about that. I am fidgety sometimes, I know;
and I scolded him last Friday. But now he may
come anyhow, if he will only come to me. I am
so dull without him.”</p>

<p>“You will never see him more”&mdash;Bull Garnet
whispered through a flood of tears, like grass
waving out of water&mdash;”until it pleases God to
take you home, where son and father go alike;
sometimes one first, sometimes other, as His holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
will is. He came to an unholy end. I tell you
again&mdash;I shot him.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me; I donʼt quite understand. There
was a grey hare, with a nick in her ear, who came
to the breakfast&ndash;room window all through the hard
weather last winter, and he promised me not to
shoot her; and I am sure that he cannot have done
it, because he is so soft&ndash;hearted, and that is why I
love him so. Talk of Cradock&mdash;talk of Cradock!
Perhaps he is cleverer than Viley&mdash;though I never
will believe it&mdash;but is he half so soft and sweet?
Will the pigeons sit on his shoulder so, and the
dogs nuzzle under his coat&ndash;lap? Tell me that&mdash;tell
me that&mdash;Bull Garnet.”</p>

<p>He leaned on the strong arm of his steward, and
looked eagerly for his answer; then trembled with
an exceeding great fear, to see that he was weeping.
That such a man should weep! But Garnet
forced himself to speak.</p>

<p>“You cannot listen to me now; I will come
again, and talk to you. God knows the agony to
me; and worst of all that it is for nothing. Yet
all of it not a thousandth part of the anguish I
have caused. Perhaps it is wisest so. Perhaps it
is for my childrenʼs sake that I, who have killed
your pet child, cannot make you know it. Yet it
adds to my despair, that I have killed the father
too.”</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing voice from silence, dazed himself,
and blurred, and giddy&mdash;so strong is contagion
of the mind&mdash;Bull Garnet went to the stables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
saddled a horse without calling groom, and rode
off at full gallop to Dr. Buller. By the time he
got there his business habits and wonted fashion
of thought had returned, and he put what he came
for in lucid form, tersely, crisply, dryly, as if in the
world there were no such thing as ill&ndash;regulated
emotion&mdash;except on the part of other people.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Dr. Buller; “his mind is
as sound as yours or mine, and his constitution excellent.
He has been troubled a good deal; but
bless me&mdash;I know a man who lost his three children
in a month, and could scarcely pay for their coffins,
sir. And his wife only six weeks afterwards. That
is what I call trouble, sir!”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet knew, from his glistening eyes, and
the quivering of his grey locks, that the man he
spoke of was himself. Reassured about Sir Cradock,
yet fearing to try him further at present,
Mr. Garnet went heavily homewards, after begging
Dr. Buller to call, as if by chance, at the Hall, observe,
and attend to the master.</p>

<p>Heavily and wearily Bull Garnet went to the
home which once had been so sweet to him, and
was now beloved so painfully. The storms of
earth were closing round him, only the stars of
heaven were bright. Myriad as the forest leaves,
and darkly moving in like manner, fears, and
doubts, and miseries sprang and trembled through
him.</p>

<p>No young maid at his door to meet him lovingly
and gaily. None to say, “Oh, darling father, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
hungry you must be, dear!” Only Pearl, so wan
and cold, and scared of soft affection. And as she
timidly approached, then dropped her eyes before
his gaze, and took his hat submissively, as if she
had no lips to kiss, no hand to lay on his shoulder,
he saw with one quick glance that still some new
grief had befallen her, that still another trouble
was come to make its home with her.</p>

<p>“What is it, Pearl?” he asked her, sadly;
“come in here and tell me.” He never called her
his Pearly now, his little native, or pretty pet, as
he used to do in the old days. They had dropped
those little endearments.</p>

<p>“You will be sorry to hear it&mdash;sorry, I mean,
that it happened; but I could not have done otherwise.”</p>

<p>“I never hear anything, now, Pearl, but what
I am sorry to hear. This will make little difference.”</p>

<p>“So I suppose,” she answered. “Mr. Pell has
been here to&ndash;day, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, father, you know
what.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have not been informed of anything.
What do I know of Mr. Pell?”</p>

<p>“More than he does of you, sir. He asked me
to be his wife.”</p>

<p>“He is a good man. But of course you said
‘No.’”</p>

<p>“Of course I did. Of course, of course. What
else can I ever say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>She leaned her white cheek on the high oak
mantel, and a little deep sob came from her heart.</p>

<p>“Would you have liked to say ‘Yes,’ Pearl?”
her father asked very softly, going to put his arm
round her waist, and then afraid to do it.</p>

<p>“Oh no! oh no! At least, not yet, though I
respect him very highly. But I told him that I
never could, and never could tell him the reason.
And oh, I was so sorry for him&mdash;he looked so hurt
and disappointed.”</p>

<p>“You shall tell him the reason very soon, or
rather the newspapers shall.”</p>

<p>“Father, donʼt say that; dear father, you are
bound for our sake. I donʼt care for him one atom,
father, compared with&mdash;compared with you, I
mean. Only I thought I must tell you, because&mdash;oh,
you know what I mean. And even if I did
like him, what would it matter about me? Oh,
father, I often think that I have been too hard
upon you, and all of it through me, and my vile
concealment!”</p>

<p>“My daughter, I am not worthy of you. Would
God that you could forgive me!”</p>

<p>“I have done it long ago, father. Do you
think a child of yours could help it, after all your
sorrow?”</p>

<p>“My child, look kindly at me; try to look as if
you loved me.”</p>

<p>She turned to him with such a look as a man
only gets once in his life, and then she fell upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
his neck, and forgot the world and all it held,
except her own dear father. Wrong he might have
done, wrong (no doubt) he had done; but who was
she, his little child, to remember it against him?
She lay for a moment in his arms, overcome with
passion, leaning back, as she had done there, when
a weanling infant. For him it was the grandest
moment of his passionate life&mdash;a fatherʼs powerful
love, ennobled by the presence of his God. Such
a moment teaches us the grandeur of our race, the
traces of a higher world stamped on us indelibly.
Then we feel, and try to own, that in spite of
satire, cynicism, and the exquisite refinements of
the purest selfishness, there is, in even the sharpest
and the shallowest of us, something kind and solid,
some abiding element of the all&ndash;pervading goodness.</p>

<p>“Now I will go through with it”&mdash;Bull Garnet
was recovering&mdash;”my own child; go and fetch
your brother, if it will not be too much for you.
If you think it will, only send him.”</p>

<p>“Father, I will fetch him. I may be able to
help you both. And now I am so much better.”</p>

<p>Presently she returned with Bob, who looked
rather plagued and uncomfortable, with a great
slice of cork in one hand and a bottle of gum in
the other, and a regular housewife of needles in the
lappet of his coat. He was going to mount a specimen
of a variety of “devilʼs coach&ndash;horse,” which
he had never seen before, and whose tail was forked
like a trident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never can let me alone,” said Bob; “just
ready to begin I was; and I am sure to spoil his
thorax. He is getting stiff every moment.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet looked at him brightly and gladly,
even at such a time. Little as he knew or cared
about the things that crawl and hop&mdash;as he ignorantly
put it&mdash;skilled no more in natural history
than our early painters were, yet from his own
strong sense he perceived that his son had a special
gift; and a special gift is genius, and may (with
good luck) climb eminence. Then he thought of
what he had to tell him, and the power of his heart
was gone.</p>

<p>It was the terror of this moment which had
dwelt with him night and day, more than the fear
of public shame, of the gallows, or of hell. To be
loathed and scorned by his only son! Oh that
Pearl had not been so true; oh that Bob suspected
something, or had even found it out for himself!
Then the father felt that now came part of his expiation.</p>

<p>Bob looked at him quite innocently with wonder
and some fear. To him “the governor” long had
been the strangest of all puzzles, sometimes so soft
and loving, sometimes so hard and terrible. Perhaps
poor Bob would catch it now for his doings
with Eoa.</p>

<p>“Sit down there, my son. Not there, but
further from me. Donʼt be at all afraid, my boy.
I have no fault to find with you. I am far luckier
in my son, than you are in your father. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
try to bear terrible news, Bob. Your sister long
has borne it.”</p>

<p>Pearl, who was ghastly pale and trembling, stole
a glance at each of them from the dark end of the
room, then came up bravely into the lamplight,
took Bobʼs hand and kissed him, and sat close by
to comfort him.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet sighed from the depths of his heart.
His children seemed to be driven from him, and to
crouch together in fear of him.</p>

<p>“It serves me right. I know that, of course.
That only makes it the worse to bear.”</p>

<p>“Father, what is it?” cried Bob, leaping up, and
dropping his cork&ndash;slice and gum&ndash;bottle; “whatever
the matter is, father, tell me, that I may stand by
you.”</p>

<p>“You cannot stand by me in this. When you
know what it is, you will fly from me.”</p>

<p>“Will I, indeed! A likely thing. Oh, father,
you think I am such a soft, because I am fond of
little things.”</p>

<p>“Would you stand by your father, Bob, if you
knew that he was a murderer?”</p>

<p>“Oh come,” said Bob, “you are drawing it a
little too strong, dad. You never could be that,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I not only can be, but am, my son.”</p>

<p>Father and son looked at one another. The
governor standing square and broad, with his
shoulders thrown well back, and no trace of emotion
in form or face, except that his quick wide
nostrils quivered, and his lips were white. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
stripling gazing up at him, seeking for some sign
of jest, seeking for a ray of laughter in his fatherʼs
eyes; too young to comprehend the power and fury
of large passion.</p>

<p>Ere either spoke another word&mdash;for the father
was hurt at the sonʼs delay, and the son felt all
abroad in his head&mdash;between them glided Pearl,
the daughter, the sister, the gentle woman&mdash;the
one most wronged of all, and yet the quickest to
forgive it.</p>

<p>“Darling, he did it for my sake,” she whispered
to her brother, though it cut through her heart to
say it. “Father, oh father, Bob is so slow; donʼt
be angry with him. Come to me a moment, father.
Oh, how I love and honour you!”</p>

<p>Those last few words to the passionate man
were like heaven poured into hell. That a child
of his should still honour him! He kissed her
with tenfold the love young man has for maiden;
then he turned away and wept, as if the earth was
water.</p>

<p>Very little more was said. Pearl went away to
Bob, and whispered how the fatal grief befell;
and Bob wept great tears for the sake of all, and
most of all for his fatherʼs sake. Then, as the
father lay cramped up upon the little sofa, wrestling
with the power of life and the promise of
death, Bob came up, and kissed him dearly on his
rugged forehead.</p>

<p>“Is that you, my own dear son? God is far
too good to me.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="p2">That night the man of violence enjoyed the
first sweet dreamless sleep that had spread its
velvet shield between him and his guilt and sorrow.
Pearl, who had sat up late with Bob, comforting
and crying with him, listened at her fatherʼs door,
and heard his quiet breathing. Through many
months of trouble, now, she had watched him
kindly, tenderly, fearing ever some wild outbreak
upon others or himself, hiding in her empty heart
all its desolation.</p>

<p>The very next day, Bull Garnet resolved to
have it out with his son; not to surprise him by
emotion to a hasty issue, but now to learn what
he thought and felt, after taking his time about it.
All this we need not try to tell, only so much as
bears upon the staple of the story.</p>

<p>“Father, I know that you had&mdash;you had good
reason for doing it.”</p>

<p>“There could be no good reason. There might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
be, and were, many bad ones. Of this I will not
speak to you. I did it in violence and fury, and
under a false impression. When I saw him, with
his arm cast round my pure and darling Pearl,
Satanʼs rage is but a smile compared to the fury
of my heart. He had his gun, and I had mine;
I had taken it to shoot a squirrel which meddled
with our firework nonsense. I tore her from him
before I could speak, thrust her aside, stepped
back two paces, gave him ‘one, two, three,’ and
fired. He had time to fire in self&ndash;defence, and his
muzzle was at my head, and his finger on the
trigger; but there it crooked, and he could not
pull. Want of nerve, I suppose. I saw his finger
shaking, and then I saw him fall. Now, my son,
you know everything.”</p>

<p>“Why, father, after all then, it was nothing
worse than a duel. He had just the same chance
of killing you, and would have done it, only you
were too quick for him.”</p>

<p>“Even to retain your love, I will have no lie in
the matter, Bob, although a duel, in my opinion,
is only murder made game of. But this was no
duel, no manslaughter even, but an act of downright
murder. No English jury could help convicting
me, and I will never plead insanity. It
was the inevitable result of inborn violence and
self&ndash;will, growing and growing from year to year,
and strengthened by wrongs of which you know
nothing. God knows that I have fought against
it; but my weapon was pride, not humility. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
let this miserable subject never be recurred to by
us, at least in words, till the end comes. As soon
as I hear that poor innocent Cradock is apprehended,
and brought to England, I shall surrender
myself and confess. But for your sake and poor
Pearlyʼs, I should have done so at the very outset.
Now it is very likely that I may not have the
option. Two persons know that I did it, although
they have no evidence, so far as I am aware; a
third person more than suspects it, and is seeking
about for the evidence. Moreover, Sir Cradock
Nowell, to whom, as I told you, I owned my deed,
although he could not then understand me, may
have done so since, or may hereafter do so, at any
lucid interval.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, father, he never would be so
mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is bound by his duty to do it&mdash;and for his
living sonʼs sake he must. I only tell you these
things, my son, to spare you a part of the shock.
One month now is all I crave, to do my best for
you two darlings. I will not ruin the chance by
going again to Sir Cradock. God saved me from
my own rash words, doubtless for your pure sake.
Now, knowing all, and reflecting upon it, can you
call me still your father, Bob?”</p>

<p>This was one of the times that tell whether a
father has through life thought more of himself or
of his children. If of himself, they fall away, like
Southern ivies in a storm, parasites which cannot
cling, but glide on the marble surface. But if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
has made his future of them, closer they cling,
and clasp more firmly, like our British ivy engrailed
into the house wall.</p>

<p>So the Garnet family clung together, although
no longer blossoming, but flagging sorely with
blight and canker, and daily fear of the woodman.
Bob, of course, avoided Eoa, to her great indignation,
though he could not quite make up his mind
to tell her that all was over, without showing
reason for it. In the forcing temperature of
trouble, he was suddenly become a man, growing
daily more like his father, in all except the violence.
He roamed no more through the wilds of
the forest, but let the birds nest comfortably, the
butterflies hover in happiness, and the wireworm
cast his shard unchallenged. He would care for
all those things again, if he ever recovered his
comfort.</p>

<p>Now Eoa, as everybody knew, did not by any
means embody the spirit of toleration. She would
hardly allow any will but her own in anything that
concerned her. In a word, she was a child, a very
warm&ndash;hearted and lovely one, but therefore all the
more requiring a strong will founded on common
sense to lead her into the life&ndash;brunt. And so,
if she must have Bob some day, she had better
have him consolidated, though reduced to three
per cent.</p>

<p>Not discerning her own interests, she would have
been wild as a hare ought to be at the vernal equinox,
but for one little fact. There was nobody to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
be jealous of. Darling Amy, whom she loved as
all young ladies love one another&mdash;until they see
cause to the contrary&mdash;sweet thing, she was gone
to Oxford with her dear, good father. They had
slipped off without any fuss at all (except from
Biddy OʼGaghan, who came and threw an old shoe
at them), because Mr. Rosedew, in the first place,
felt that he could not bear it, and thought, in the
second place, that it would be an uncourteous act
towards Sir Cradock Nowell to allow any demonstration.
And yet it was notorious that even Job
Hogstaff had arranged to totter down on Mark
Stoteʼs arm, followed by a dozen tenants (all of
whom had leases), and the rank and file of Nowelhurst,
who had paid their house&ndash;rent; and then
there would be a marshalling outside the parsonage&ndash;gate;
and upon the appearance of the fly, Job
with his crutch would testify, whereupon a shout
would arise pronouncing everlasting divorce between
Church and State in Nowelhurst, undying
gratitude to the former, and defiance to the latter
power.</p>

<p>Yet all this programme was nullified by the departure
of John and his household gods at five
oʼclock one May morning. Already he had received
assurance from some of his ancient co&ndash;mates
at Oriel (most cohesive of colleges) that they
would gladly welcome him, and find him plenty
of work to do. In less than six weeks’ time, of
course, the long vacation would begin. What of
that? Let him come at once, and with his widespread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
reputation he must have the pick of all the
men who would stay up to read for honours. For
now the fruit of a lifetime lore was ripening over
his honoured head, not (like that of Tantalus)
wafted into the cloud&ndash;land, not even waiting to be
plucked at, but falling unawares into his broad
and simple bosom, where it might lie uncared for,
except for the sake of Amy. So large a mind had
long outlived the little itch for fame, quite untruly
called “the last infirmity of noble minds.” Their
first it is, beyond all doubt; and wisely nature
orders it. Their last is far more apt to be&mdash;at
least in this generation&mdash;contempt of fame, and
man, and God, except for practical purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedewʼs careful treatises upon the Sabellian
and Sabello&ndash;Oscan elements had stirred up
pleasant controversy in the narrow world of scholars;
and now at the trito&ndash;megistic blow of the
Roseo&ndash;rorine hammer, ringing upon no less a
theme than the tables of Iguvium, the wise men
who sit round the board of classical education,
even Jupiter Grabovius (the original of John
Bull), had clapped their hands and cried, “Hear,
hear! He knows what he is talking of; and he is
one of us.”</p>

<p>That, after all, is the essence of it&mdash;to know
what one is talking of. And the grand advantage
of the ancient universities is, not the tone of manners,
not the knowledge of life&mdash;rather a hat&ndash;box
thing with them&mdash;not even the high ideal, the
manliness, and the chivalry, which the better class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of men win; but the curt knowledge, whether or
not they are talking of what they know. <i>Scire
quod nescias</i> is taught, if they teach us nothing
else. And though we are all still apt to talk,
especially among ladies, of things beyond our acquaintance&mdash;else
haply we talk but little&mdash;we do
so with a qualm, and quasi, and fluttering sense
that effrontery is not&mdash;but leads to&mdash;”pluck.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, who am I to talk, proving myself,
by every word, false to Alma Mater, having ventured
all along to talk of things beyond me?</p>

<p>As they rose the hill towards Carfax, Amy
(tired as she was) trembled with excitement. Her
father had won a cure in St. Oles&mdash;derived no
doubt from <i>oleo</i>&mdash;and all were to lodge in Pembroke
Lane, pending mature arrangements. Though
they might have turned off near the jail, and saved
a little cab fare, John would go by the broader way,
as his fashion always was; except in a little posthumous
matter, wherein perhaps we have over&ndash;defined
with brimstone the direction&ndash;posts.</p>

<p>Be that as it may,&mdash;not to press the <i>scire quod
nescias</i> (potential in such a case, I hope, rather
than conjunctive)&mdash;there they must be left, all
three, with Jenny and Jemima outside, and Jem
Pottles on the pavement, amazed at the cheek of
everything. Only let one thing be said. Though
prettier girl than Amy Rosedew had never stepped
on the stones of Oxford since the time of Amy
Robsart, if even then,&mdash;never once, was she insulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Lowest of all low calumnies. There are blackguards
among university men, as everybody knows,
and as there must be among all men. But even
those blackguards can see the difference between a
lady, or rather between a pure girl and&mdash;another.
And even those blackguards have an intensified
reverence for the one;&mdash;but let the matter pass;
for now we hide in gold these subjects, and sham
not to see their flaunting.</p>

<p>Be it, however, confessed that Amy (whose
father soon had rooms in college, not to live, but
to lecture in), being a very shy young maiden,
never could be brought to come and call him to
his tea,&mdash;oh no. So many young men in gorgeous
trappings, charms, and dangles, and hooks of gold,
and eye&ndash;glasses very knowing&mdash;not to mention
volunteer stuff, and knickerbockers demonstrant
of calf&mdash;oddly enough they <i>would</i> happen to feel
so interested in the architecture of the porterʼs
lodge whenever Amy came by, never gazing too
warmly at her, but contriving to convey their
regret at the suppression of their sentiments, and
their yearning to be the stones she trod on, and
their despair at the possibility of her not caring if
they were so&mdash;really all this was so trying, that
Amy would never go into college without Aunt
Doxy before her, gazing four&ndash;gunned cupolas even
at scouts and manciples. And this was very provoking
of her, not only to the hearts that beat
under waistcoats ordered for her sake, but also to
the domestic kettle a&ndash;boil in Pembroke Lane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
For, over and over again, Uncle John, great as
he was in chronology and every kind of “marmora,”
and able to detect a flaw upon Potamogeitonʼs
tombstone, lost all sense of time and place,
<i>me</i> and <i>te</i>, and <i>hocce</i> and Doxy, and calmly went
home some two hours late, and complacently received
Doxology.</p>

<p>But alas, we must abandon Amy to the insidious
designs of Hebdomadal Board, the velvet approaches
of Proctor and Pro, and the brass of the
gentlemen Bedels, while we regard more rugged
scenes, from which she was happily absent.</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton had found the missing link, and
at the same time the strongest staple, of the desired
evidence. The battered gun&ndash;barrels had
been identified, and even the number deciphered,
by the foreman of Messrs. L&mdash;&mdash; and Co. And
the entry in their books of the sale of that very
gun (number, gauge, and other particulars beyond
all doubt corresponding) was&mdash;”to Bull Garnet,
&amp;c., Nowelhurst Dell Cottage,” whom also they
could identify from his “strongly&ndash;marked physiognomy,”
and his quick, decisive manner. And the
cartridge&ndash;case, which had lain so long in Dr.
Huttonʼs pocket, of course they could not depose
to its sale, together with the gun; but this they
could show, that it fitted the gauge, was not at all
of a common gauge, but two sizes larger&mdash;No. 10,
in fact&mdash;and must have been sold during the
month in which they sold the gun, because it was
one of a sample which they had taken upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
approval, and soon discarded for a case of better
manufacture.</p>

<p>Then as to motive, Rufus Hutton himself could
depose to that, or the probability of it, from what
he had seen, but not understood, at the fixing of
the fireworks; neither had he forgotten the furious
mood of Bull Garnet, both then and in his
garden.</p>

<p>While he was doubting how to act&mdash;for, clearly
as he knew his power to hang the man who had
outraged him, the very fact of his injury made
him loth to use that power; for he was not at all
a vindictive man, now the heat of the thing was
past, and he saw that the sudden attack had been
made in self&ndash;defence&mdash;while he was hesitating
between his sense of duty and pity for Cradock
on one hand, and his ideas of magnanimity and
horror of hanging a man on the other, he was
thrown, without any choice or chance, across the
track of Simon Chope.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no more vulgar error, no
stronger proof of ignorance and slavery to catchwords,
than to abuse or think ill of any particular
class of men, solely on account of their profession&mdash;although,
perhaps, we might justly throw the
<i>onus probandi</i> their merit upon hangmen, body&ndash;snatchers,
informers, and a few others&mdash;yet may
I think (deprecating most humbly the omen of
this conjunction) that solicitors, tailors, and Methodist
parsons fight at some disadvantage both in
fact and in fiction? Yet can they hold their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
own; and sympathy, if owing, is sure to have to
pay them&mdash;notwithstanding, goose, and amen.</p>

<p>Away with all feeble flippancy! Heavy tidings
came to Nowelhurst Hall, Dell Cottage, and
Geopharmacy Lodge, simultaneously, as might
be, on the 20th of June. The <i>Taprobane</i> had
been lost, with every soul on board; and this is
the record of it, enshrined in many journals:&mdash;</p>

<p>“By recent advices from Capetown, per the
screw&ndash;steamer <i>Sutler</i>, we sincerely regret to learn
that the magnificent clipper&ndash;built ship <i>Taprobane</i>,
of 2200 tons (new system), A 1 at Lloydʼs for
15 years, and bound from the Thames to Colombo,
with a cargo valued by competent judges at
120,000<i>l.</i>, took the shore in Benguela Bay during
a typhoon of unprecedented destructiveness. It is
our melancholy duty to add that the entirety of
the valuable cargo was entirely lost, although very
amply assured in unexceptionable quarters, and
that every soul on board was consigned to a watery
grave. A Portuguese gentleman of good family
and large fortune, who happened to be in the
neighbourhood, was an eye&ndash;witness to the catastrophe,
and made superhuman exertions to rescue
the unfortunate mariners, but, alas! in vain.
Senhor José de Calcavello has arrived at the
conclusion that some of her copper may be saved.
The ill&ndash;fated bark broke up so rapidly, from the
powerful action of the billows, that her identity
could only be established from a portion of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sternpost, which was discovered half buried in
sand three nautical miles to the southward. We
have been informed, upon good authority, although
we are not at liberty to mention our source of
information, that Her Britannic Majestyʼs steamcorvette
<i>Mumbo Jumbo</i>, pierced for twenty&ndash;eight
guns, and carrying two, is under orders to depart,
as soon as ever she can be coaled, for the scene
of the recent catastrophe. Meanwhile, the tug
<i>Growler</i> has arrived with all the memorials of
the calamity, after affording the rites of sepulture
to the poor shipwrecked mariners cast up by the
treacherous billows. The set of the current being
so adverse, we have reason to fear that the rest of
the bodies must have fallen a prey to the monsters
of the deep. There are said to be some hopes of
recovering a portion of the specie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore happened to be calling at
Geopharmacy Lodge, when the London papers
arrived in the early afternoon. Rufus begged
pardon, and broke the cover, to see something in
which he was interested. Presently he cried,
“Good God!” and let the paper fall; and,
seasoned as he was, and shallowed by the shifting
of his life, it was not in his power to keep two
little tears from twinkling.</p>

<p>“Too late all my work,” he said; “Heaven has
settled it without me.”</p>

<p>“How very sad!” cried Mrs. Corklemore,
dashing aside an unbidden tear, when she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to the end of the story; “to think of all those
brave men lost! And perhaps you knew some of
them, Dr. Hutton? Oh, I am so sorry!”</p>

<p>“Why, surely you know that the <i>Taprobane</i> was
the ship in which poor Cradock Nowell sailed,
under Mr. Rosedewʼs auspices.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not. Please not to say so. It
would be so very horrible! That he should go
without repenting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You must have forgotten, Mrs. Corklemore;
for I heard Rosa tell you the name of the ship,
and her destination.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very likely. Ah, now I remember. For
the moment it quite escaped me. How truly,
truly grieved&mdash;it has quite overcome me. Oh,
please not to notice me&mdash;please not. I am so
stupidly soft&ndash;hearted. Oh&mdash;ea, isha, ea!”</p>

<p>No woman in the world could cry more beautifully
than poor Georgie. And now she cried her
very best. It would have gone to the heart of the
driest and bitterest sceptic that ever doubted all
men and women because they would doubt him. But
Rufus, whose form of self&ndash;assertion was not universal
negation, in what manner then do you suppose
that Rufus Hutton was liquefied? A simple sort
of fellow he was (notwithstanding all his shrewdness),
although, or perhaps I should say because,
he thought himself so knowing; and his observation
was more the result of experience than the
cause of it. So away he ran to fetch Rosa, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Rosa wiped dear, sensitive Georgieʼs eyes, and
coaxed her very pleasantly, and admired her more
than ever.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet rode home at twelve oʼclock from a
long morningʼs work. He never could eat any
breakfast now, and his manner was to leave home
at six (except when he went to Winchester),
gallop fiercely from work to work, or sometimes
walk his horse and think, often with glistening
eyes (when any little thing touched him), and
return to his cottage and rest there during the
workmenʼs dinner&ndash;time. Then he had some sort
of a meal himself, which Pearl began to call
“dinner,” and away with a fresh horse in half an
hour, spending his body if only so he might earn
rest of mind. All this was telling upon him fearfully;
even his muscular force was going, and his
quickness of eye and hand failing him. He knew
it, and was glad.</p>

<p>Only none should ever say, though every crime
was heaped upon him, that he had neglected his
masterʼs interests.</p>

<p>He tore the paper open in his sudden turbulent
fashion, as if all paper was rags, and no more; and
with one glance at each column knew all that was
in the ‘tween&ndash;ways. Suddenly he came to a place
at the corner of a page which made him cease from
eating. He glanced at Pearl, but she was busy,
peeling new potatoes for him. Bob was not come
in yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Darling, I must go to London. If possible I
shall return to&ndash;night, if I catch the one oʼclock up
express.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the window, and ordered a
horse, his loud voice ringing and echoing round
every corner of the cottage, and in five minutes he
was off at full gallop, for the express would not
stop at Brockenhurst.</p>

<p>At 3.15 he was in London, and at 3.40 in the
counting&ndash;house of Messrs. Brown and Smithson,
owners, or at any rate charterers, of the <i>Taprobane</i>,
Striped&ndash;ball Chambers, Fenchurch Street. There
he would learn, if he could, what their private
advices were.</p>

<p>The clerks received him very politely, and told
him that they had little doubt of the truth of the
evil tidings. Of course the fatality might have
been considerably exaggerated, &amp;c. &amp;c., but as to
the loss of the ship, they had taken measures to
replace her. Would he mind waiting only ten
minutes, though they saw that he was in a hurry?
The Cape mail&ndash;ship had been telegraphed from
Falmouth; they had sent to the office already, and
expected to get the reply within a quarter of an
hour. Every information in their power, &amp;c.&mdash;we
all know the form, though we donʼt always get the
civility.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet waited heavily with his great back
against a stout brass rail, having declined the chair
they offered him; and in less than five minutes he
received authentic detail of everything. He listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to nothing except one statement, “every soul on
board was lost, sir.”</p>

<p>Then he went out, in a lumpish manner, from
the noble room, and was glad to get hold of the iron
rail in the bend of the dark stone staircase.</p>

<p>So now he was a double murderer. Finding it
not enough to have killed one brother in his fury,
he had slain the other twin through his cowardly
concealment. Floating about in tropical slime,
without a shark to eat him, leaving behind him the
fair repute of a money&ndash;grabbing fratricide. And
he, the man who had done it all, who had loved the
boy and ruined him, miserably plotting for his own
far inferior children. No, no! Not that at any
rate,&mdash;good and noble children: and how they had
borne his villainy! God in mercy only make him,
try to make him, over again, and how different his
life would be. All his better part brought out; all
his lower kicked away to the devil, the responsible
father of it. “Good God, how my heart goes!
Death is upon me, well I know, but let me die with
my children by&mdash;unless I turn hymn&ndash;writer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Quick as he was in his turns of thought&mdash;all of
them subjective&mdash;he was scarcely a match for the
situation, when Mr. Chope and Bailey Kettledrum
brushed by the sleeves of his light overcoat, and
entered the doors with “push&mdash;pull” on them, but,
being both of the pushing order rather than the
pulling, employed indiscriminate propulsion, and
were out of sight in a moment. Still, retaining
some little of his circumspective powers, Bull Garnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
knew them both from a corner flash of his sad
tear&ndash;laden eyes. There was no mistaking that great
legal head, like the breech&ndash;end of a cannon. Mr.
Kettledrum might have been overlooked, for little
men of a fussy nature are common enough in
London, or for that matter everywhere else. But
Garnetʼs attention being drawn, he knew them both
of course, and the errand they were come upon, and
how soon they were likely to return, and what they
would think of his being there, if they should
happen to see him. Nevertheless, he would not
budge. Nothing could matter much now. He
must think out his thoughts.</p>

<p>When this puff of air was past which many
breathe almost long enough to learn that it was
“life,” some so long as to weary of it, none so long
as to understand all its littleness and greatness&mdash;when
that should be gone from him, and absorbed
into a boundless region even more unknown, would
not the wrong go with it, if unexpiated here, and
abide there evermore? And not to think of himself
alone&mdash;what an example now to leave to his
innocent injured children! The fury hidden by
treachery, the cowardice sheathed in penitence!
D&mdash;&mdash;n it all, he would have no more of it. His
cursed mind was made up. A man can die in the
flesh but once. His spirit had been dying daily,
going to the devil daily, every day for months; and
he found no place for repentance. As for his
children, they must abide it. No man of any
mind would blame them for their fatherʼs crime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
If it was more than they could bear, let them bolt
to America. Anywhither, anywhere, so long as
they came home in heaven&mdash;if he could only get
there&mdash;to the father who had injured, ruined,
bullied, cursed, and loved them so.</p>

<p>After burning out this hell of thought in his
miserable brain, he betook himself to natureʼs
remedy,&mdash;instant, headlong action. He rushed
down the stairs, forgetting all about Chope and
Bailey Kettledrum, shouted to the driver of a
hansom cab so that he sawed his horseʼs mouth
raw, leaped in, and gave him half a sovereign
through the pigeon&ndash;hole, to get to D&mdash;&mdash;ʼs bank
before the closing time. But at Temple Bar, of
course, there was a regular Chubbʼs lock, after a
minor Bramah one at the bottom of Ludgate Hill.
Cabby was forced to cut it, and slash up Chancery
Lane, and across by Kingʼs College Hospital, and
back into the Strand by Wych Street. It is easy
to imagine Bull Garnetʼs state of mind; yet the
imagination would be that, and nothing more.
He sat quite calmly, without a word, knowing that
man and horse were doing their utmost of skill and
speed, and having dealt enough with both to know
that to worry them then is waste.</p>

<p>The Bank had been closed, the day&ndash;porter said,
as he girded himself for his walk to Brixton,
exactly&mdash;let him see&mdash;yes, exactly one minute and
thirty&ndash;five seconds ago. Most of the gentlemen
were still inside, of course, and if the gentlemanʼs
business was of a confidential&mdash;&mdash;Here he intimated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
not by words, that there were considerations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bow Street police&ndash;office,” Mr. Garnet cried to
the driver, not even glancing again at the disappointed
doorkeeper. In five minutes he was
there. Man and horse seemed strung and nerved
with his own excitement.</p>

<p>A stolid policeman stood at the door, as Bull
Garnet leaped out anyhow, with his high colour
gone away as in death, and his wiry legs cramped
with vehemence. Then Bobby saw that he had
met his master, the perception being a mental feat
far beyond the average leap of police agility.
Accordingly he touched his hat, and crinkled his
eyes in a manner discovered by policemen, in
consequence of the suggestion afforded by the
pegging of their hats.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bennings gone?” asked Bull Garnet,
pushing towards the entrance.</p>

<p>“His wusship is gone arf an hour, sir; or may
be at most fifty minutes. Can we do anything for
you, sir? His wusship always go according to the
business as is on.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Mr. Garnet; “that is
quite enough. What time do they leave at Marlborough
Street?”</p>

<p>“According to the business, sir, but gone afore
us aʼmost always. We sits as long as anybody, and
gets through twice the business. But any message
you like to leave, or anything to be entered, I can
take the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“No. It does not matter. I will only leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
my card. Mr. Bennings knows me. Be kind
enough to give him this, when he comes to&ndash;morrow
morning. Perhaps I may call to&ndash;morrow. At present
I cannot say.”</p>

<p>The policeman lifted his hat again, like a cup
taken up from a saucer, and Bull Garnet sat heavily
down in the cab, and banged the door&ndash;shutters
before him. “Strand,” he called out to the driver;
“D&mdash;&mdash; and C&mdash;&mdash;ʼs, the watchmakers.” There
he bought a beautiful watch and gold chain for
his daughter Pearl, giving a cheque for nearly all
his balance at the bankerʼs. The cheque was so
large that in common prudence the foreman declined
to cash it without some confirmation; but
Mr. Garnet gave him a reference, which in ten
minutes was established, and in ten more he was off
again with his very handsome trinkets, and a large
sum in bank&ndash;notes and gold, the balance of his
draft.</p>

<p>“Where now, sir?” shouted the driver, delighted
with his fare, and foreseeing another half&ndash;sovereign.</p>

<p>“I will tell you in thirty seconds.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he ainʼt a rum ‘un,” Cabby muttered
to himself, while amid volleys of strong language
he kept his horse gyrating, like a twin&ndash;screw ship
trying circles; “but rum customers is our windfalls.
Should have thought it a reward case, only
for the Bobby. Keep a look&ndash;out, anyhow; unless
he orders me back to Bedlam.”</p>

<p>“Not Bedlam. Waterloo Station, main line!”
said Bull Garnet, standing up in front, and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
at him over the roof. “Five minutes is all I give
you, mind.”</p>

<p>“What a blessed fool I am,” said the cabman
below his breath, but lashing his horse explosively&mdash;”to
throw away half a sovereign sooner than
hold my tongue! He must be the devil himself
to have heard me&mdash;and as for eyes&mdash;good Lord,
I shouldnʼt like to drive him much.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” replied Mr. Garnet through
the pigeon&ndash;hole, handing him twopence for the
tollman; “I am not the devil, sir; as you may
some day know. Have no fear of ever driving
me again. You shall have your half&ndash;sovereign
when I have got my ticket. Follow me in, and
you shall know for what place I take it.”</p>

<p>The cabman was too dumb&ndash;foundered to do anything
but resolve that he would go straight home
when he got his money, and tell his old woman
about it. Then he applied himself to the whip in
earnest, for he could not too soon be rid of this
job; and so Bull Garnet won his train, and gave
the driver the other half&ndash;sovereign, with a peculiar
nod, having noticed that he feared to approach
while the ticket was applied for.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet took a second&ndash;class ticket. His
extravagance towards the cabman was the last he
would ever exhibit. He felt a call upon him now
to save for his family every farthing. All was lost
to them but money, and alas, too much of that.
Now if he cut his throat in the train, could he be
attainted of felony? And would God be any the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
harder on him? No, he did not think He would.
It might be some sort of atonement even. But
then the shock to Pearl and Bob, to see him brought
home with his head hanging back, and hopeless
red stitches under it. It would make the poor girl
a maniac, after all the shocks and anguish he had
benumbed her with already. What a fool he had
been not to buy strychnine, prussic acid, or laudanum!
And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;He
would like to see them just once more&mdash;blessed
hearts&mdash;once more.</p>

<p>He sat in the last compartment of the last carriage
in the train, which had been added, in a hurry,
immediately behind the break van, and the swinging
and the jerking very soon became tremendous.
He knew not, neither cared to know, that Simon
Chope and Bailey Kettledrum were in a first&ndash;class
carriage near the centre of the train. Presently
the violent motion began to tell upon him, and he
felt a heavy dullness creeping over his excited mind;
and all the senses, which had been during several
hours of tension as prompt and acute as ever they
were in his prime of power, began to flag, and
daze, and wane, and he fell into a waking dream,
a “second person” of sorrow. But first&mdash;whether
for suicide, or for self&ndash;defence, he had tried both
doors and found them locked; and he was far
too large a man to force his way through the
window.</p>

<p>He dreamed, with a loose sense of identity,
about the innocent childhood, the boyhoodʼs aspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the young manʼs sense of ability endorsing
the right to aspire. Even his bodily power and
vigour revived in the dream before him, and he
knitted his muscles, and clenched his fists, and was
ready to fight fools and liars. Who had fought
more hard and hotly against the hard cold ways of
the age, the despite done to the poor and lowly, the
sarcasm bred by self&ndash;conscious serfdom in clever
men of the world, the preference of gold to love,
and of position to happiness? All the weak gregarious
tricks, shifts of coat, and pupa&ndash;ism, whereby
we noble Christians reduce our social history to
a passage in entomology, and quench the faith of
thinking men in Him whose name we take in vain&mdash;the
great Originator&mdash;all these feminine contradictions,
and fond things foully invented, fables
Atellan (if they be not actually Fescennine) had
roused the combatism of young Bull, ere he learned
his own disgrace.</p>

<p>And when he learned it, such as it was&mdash;a proof
by its false incidence how infantile our civilization
is&mdash;all his motherʼs bitter wrong, her lifelong sense
of shame and crushing (because she had trusted a
liar, and the hollow elder&ndash;stick “institution” was
held up against her, and none would take her part
without money, even if she had wished it), then he
had chosen his motherʼs course, inheriting her strong
nature, let the shame lie where it fell by right and
not by rule, and carried all his energies into Neo&ndash;Christian
largeness.</p>

<p>All that time of angry trial now had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
before him, and the five years of his married life
(which had not been very happy, for his wife never
understood him, but met his quick moodiness with
soft sulks); and then in his dream&ndash;review he smiled,
as his children began to toddle about, and sit on
his knees, and look at him.</p>

<p>Once he awoke, and gazed about him. The
train had stopped at Winchester. He was all
alone in the carriage still, and all his cash was
safe. He had stowed it away very carefully in a
hidden pocket. To his languid surprise, he fell
back on the seat. How unlike himself, to be sure;
and with so much yet to do! He strove to arise
and rouse himself. He felt for the little flask of
wine, which Pearl had thrust into his pocket, but
he could not pull it out and drink; such a languor
lay upon him. He had felt it before, but never
before been so overcome by it. Once or twice, an
hour or so before the sun came back again, this
strange cold deadness (like a mammoth nightmare
frozen) had lain on him, in his lonely bed, and
then he knew what death was, and only came back
to life again through cold sweat and long fainting.</p>

<p>He had never consulted any doctor about the
meaning of this. With his bold way of thinking,
and judging only by his own experience and feeling,
he had long ago decided that all medical men
were quacks. What one disorder could they cure?
All they had learned, and that by a fluke, was a
way to anticipate <i>one</i>: and even that way seemed
worn out now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Now he fell away, and feared, and tried to
squeeze his breast, and tried to pray to God; but
no words came, nor any thoughts, only sense of
dying, and horror at having prayed for it. A coldness
fell upon his heart, and on his brain an ignorance;
he was falling into a great blank depth,
and nothing belonged to him any more&mdash;only utter,
utter loss, and not a dream of God.</p>

<p>Happy and religious folk, who have only died
in theory, contemplating distant death, knowing
him only as opportune among kinsfolk owning
Consols, these may hope for a Prayer&ndash;book end,
sacrament administered, weeping friends, the heavenward
soul glad to fly through the golden door,
<i>animula</i>, <i>vagula</i>, <i>blandula</i>, yet assured of its reception
with a heavenly smile of foretaste&mdash;this may
be; no doubt it may be, after the life of a Christian
Bayard; though it need not always be, even
then. All we who from our age know death, and
have taken little trips into him, through fits, paralysis,
or such&ndash;like, are quite aware that he has
at first call as much variety as life has. But
the death of the violent man is not likely to be
placid, unless it come unawares, or has been
graduated through years of remorse, and weakness,
weariness, and repentance.</p>

<p>Then he tried to rise, and fought once more,
with agony inconceivable, against the heavy yet
hollow numbness in the hold of his deep, wide
chest, against the dark, cold stealth of death, and
the black, narrow depth of the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The train ran lightly and merrily into Brockenhurst
Station, while the midsummer twilight floated
like universal gossamer. In the yard stood the
Kettledrum “rattletrap,” and the owner was right
glad to see it. In his eyes it was worth a dozen
of the lord mayorʼs coach.</p>

<p>“None of the children come, dear?” asked
Bailey, having kissed his wife, as behoves a man
from London.</p>

<p>“No, darling, not one. That&mdash;&mdash;” here she
used an adjective which sounded too much like
“odious” for me to trust my senses&mdash;”Georgie
would not allow them. Now, darling, did you do
exactly what I told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, darling Anna, I did the best I could. I
had a basin of mulligatawny at Waterloo going
up, and one of mock&ndash;turtle coming back, and at
Basingstoke ham&ndash;sandwiches, a glass of cold cognac
and water, and some lemon&ndash;chips. Since that, nothing
at all, because there has been no time.”</p>

<p>“You are a dear,” said Mrs. Kettledrum, “to
do exactly as I told you. Now come round the
corner a moment, and take two glasses of sherry;
I can see quite well to pour it out. I am so glad
of her new crinoline. She wonʼt get out. Donʼt
be afraid, dear.”</p>

<p>Oh, Georgie, Georgie! To think that her
own sister should be so low, so unfeeling, and
treacherous! Mr. Kettledrum smacked his lips,
for the sake of euphony, after the second glass of
sherry; but his wife would not give him any more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
for fear of spoiling his supper. Then they came
back, and both got in, and squeezed themselves up
together in the front seat of the old carriage, for
Mrs. Corklemore occupied the whole of the seat of
honour.</p>

<p>“You are very polite, to keep me so long. Innocent
turtles; sweet childish anxiety! The last
survivor of a wrecked train! So you took advantage,
Anna dear, of my not being dressed quite
so vulgarly as you are, to discuss this little matter
with him, keeping me in ignorance.”</p>

<p>The carriage was off by this time, and open as
it was, they had no fear of old coachey hearing,
for it took a loud hail to reach him.</p>

<p>“Take the honour of a Kettledrum,” cried
Bailey, smiting his bosom, “that the subject has
not even been broached between my wiser part
and myself. Ladies, in this pure aerial&mdash;no, I
mean ethereal&mdash;air, with the shades of night
around us, and the breezes wafting, would an exceedingly
choice and delicately aromatic cigar&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should so like it, Bailey; and perhaps
we shall have the nightingales.”</p>

<p>“I fear we must not think of it,” interposed
Mrs. Corklemore, gently; “my dress is of a fabric
quite newly introduced, very beautiful, but (like
myself) too retentive of impressions. If Mr.
Kettledrum smokes, I shall have to throw it
away.”</p>

<p>“There goes the cigar instead,” cried Bailey;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
“the paramount rights of ladies ever have been,
and ever shall be, sacred with Bailey Kettledrum.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Kettledrum was so vexed that she
jumped up, as if to watch the cigar spinning into
the darkness, and contrived with sisterly accuracy
to throw all her weight upon a certain portion of
a certain lovely foot, whereupon there ensued the
neatest little passes, into which we need not enter.
Enough that Mrs. Corklemore, having higher intellectual
gifts, “won,” in the language of the
ring, “both events”&mdash;first tear, and first hysterical
symptom.</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Mr. Kettledrum, at the very
first opportunity, to wit, when both were crying;
“we all know what sisters are: how they mingle
the&mdash;the sweetness of their affection with a certain&mdash;ah,
yes&mdash;a piquancy of expression, most
pleasant, most improving, because so highly conducive
to self&ndash;examination!” Here he stood up,
having made a hit, worthy of the House of Commons.
“All these little breezes, ladies, may be
called the trade&ndash;winds of affection. They blow
from pole to pole.”</p>

<p>“The trade&ndash;winds never do that,” said Georgie.</p>

<p>“They pass us by as the idle wind, when the
clouds are like a whale, ladies, having overcome
us for a moment, like a summer dream. Hark to
that thrush, sitting perhaps on his eggs”&mdash;”Oh,
Oh!” from the gallery of nature&mdash;”can there be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
I pause for a reply, anything but harmony, where
the voices of the night pervade, and the music of
the spheres?”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you do speak so splendidly, dear,”
sobbed Mrs. Kettledrum from the corner; “but
it is a nasty, wicked, cruel story, about dear papa
saying that of me, and he in his grave, poor dear,
quite unable to vindicate himself. I have always
thought it so unchristian to malign the dead!”</p>

<p>“Whatʼs that?” cried Georgie, starting up, in
fear and hot earnest; “you are chattering so, you
hear nothing.”</p>

<p>A horse dashed by them at full gallop, with his
rider on his neck, shouting and yelling, and clinging
and lashing.</p>

<p>“Missed the wheel by an inch,” cried Kettledrum,
drawing his head in faster than he had
thrust it out; “a fire, man, or a French invasion?”
But the man was out of hearing, while the Kettledrum
horses, scared, and jumping as from an equine
thunderbolt, tried the strength of leather and the
courage of ladies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the station behind them there was
a sad ado. A man was lifted out of the train,
being found in the last compartment by the guard
who knew his destination&mdash;a big man, and a heavy
one; and they bore him to the wretched shed which
served there as a waiting&ndash;room.</p>

<p>“Dead, I believe,” said the guard, having sent
a boy for brandy, “dead as a door&ndash;nail, whoever
he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Not thee knaw who <i>he</i> be?” cried a forester,
coming in. “Whoy, marn, there be no mistaking
<i>he</i>. He be our Muster Garnet.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” And the train whistled on, as it
must do, whether we live or die, or when Cyclops
has made mince of us.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="p2">That night there had been great excitement in
the village of Nowelhurst. A rumour had reached
it that Cradock Nowell, loved in every cottage
there, partly as their own production, partly as
their future owner, partly for his own sake, and
most of all for his misfortunes, was thrown into
prison to stand his trial for the murder of his
brother. Another rumour was that, to prevent any
scandal to the nobility, he had been sent to sea
alone in a seventy&ndash;four gun ship, with corks in her
bottom tied with wire arranged so as to fly all at
once, same as if it was ginger&ndash;beer bottles, on the
seventh day, when the salt&ndash;water had turned the
wires rusty.</p>

<p>It is hard to say of these two reports which
roused the greater indignation; perhaps on the
whole the former did, because the latter was supposed
to be according to institution. Anyhow, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the village was out in the street that night; and
the folding of arms, and the self&ndash;importance, the
confidential winks, and the power to say more (but
for hyper&ndash;Nestorean prudence) were at their acme
in a knot of gaffers gathered around Rufus Hutton,
and affording him good sport.</p>

<p>Nothing now could be done in Nowelhurst without
Rufus Hutton. He had that especial knack
(mistaken sometimes in a statesman for really high
qualities) which becomes in a woman true capacity
for gossip. By virtue thereof Rufus Hutton was
now prime&ndash;minister of Nowelhurst; and Sir Cradock,
the king, being nothing more now than the
shadow of a name, his deputyʼs power was absolute.
He knew the history by this time of every cottage,
and pigsty, and tombstone in the churchyard; how
much every man got every week, and how much
he gave his wife out of it, what he had for dinner
on Sundays, and how long he made his waistcoat
last. Suddenly the double&ndash;barrelled noise which
foreruns a horse at full gallop came from the
bridge, and old folk hobbled, and young got ready
to run.</p>

<p>“Hooraw&mdash;hooraw!” cried a dozen and a half
of boys, “here be Hempror o’ Roosia coming.”</p>

<p>Boys will believe almost anything, when they
get excited (having taken the trick from their
fathers), but even the women were disappointed,
when the galloping horse stopped short in the
crowd, and from his withers shot forward, and fell
with both hands full of mane, a personage not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
more august than the porter at Brockenhurst
Station.</p>

<p>“Catch the horse, you fool!” cried Rufus.</p>

<p>“Cuss the horse,” said the porter, trying to
draw breath; “better been under a train I had.
Donʼt stand gaping, chawbacons. Is ever a sawbones,
surgeon, doctor, or what the devil you call
them in these outlandish parts, to be got for love
or money?”</p>

<p>“I am a sawbones,” said Rufus Hutton, coming
forward with his utmost dignity; “and itʼs a mercy
I donʼt saw yours, young man, if thatʼs all you
know of riding.”</p>

<p>The porter touched his hair instead of his hat
(which was gone long ago), while the “chawbacons”
rallied, and laughed at him, and one
offered him a “zide&ndash;zaddle,” and all the women of
the village felt that Dr. Hutton had quenched the
porter, and vindicated Nowelhurst.</p>

<p>“When you have recovered your breath, young
man,” continued Rufus, pushing, as he always did,
his advantage; “and thanked God for your escape
from the first horse you ever mounted, perhaps you
will tell us your errand, and we chawbacons will
consider it.”</p>

<p>A gruff haw&ndash;haw and some treble he&ndash;heʼs added
to the porterʼs discomfiture, for he could not come
to time yet, being now in the second tense of
exhaustion, which is even worse than the first,
being rather of the heart than lungs.</p>

<p>“Station&mdash;Mr. Garnet&mdash;dead!” was all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
man could utter, and that only in spasms, and
with great chest&ndash;heavings.</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton leaped on the horse in a moment,
caught up old Channingʼs stick, and was out of
sight in the summer dusk ere any one else in the
crowd had done more than gape, and say, “Oh
Lor!” By dint of skill he sped the old horse
nearly as quickly to the station as the fury of
Jehu had brought him thence, and landed him at
the door with far less sign of exhaustion. Then
walking into the little room, in the manner of a
man who thoroughly knows his work, he saw a
sight which never in this world will leave him.</p>

<p>Upon a hard sofa, shored up with an ash&ndash;log
where the mahogany was sprung, and poked up
into a corner as if to get a bearing there, with
blankets piled upon him heavily and tucked round
the collar of his coat, and his great head hanging
over the rise where the beading of the brass
ends, lay the ill&ndash;fated Bull Garnet,&mdash;a man from
birth to death a subject for pity more than terror.
Fifty years old&mdash;more than fifty years&mdash;and
scarce a twelvemonth of happiness since the
shakings of the world began, and childhoodʼs dream
was over. Toiling ever for the future, toiling for
his children, ever since he had them, labouring to
make peace with God, if only he might have his
own, where passion is not, but love abides. The
room smelled strongly of bad brandy, some of
which was oozing now down his broad square chin,
and dripping from the great blue jaw. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
he could not swallow it; and now one of the
women (for three had rushed in) was performing
that duty for him.</p>

<p>“Turn out that drunken hag!” cried Dr. Hutton,
feeling he had no idea how. “Up with the
window. Bring the sofa here; and take all but
one of those blankets off.”</p>

<p>“But, master,” objected another woman, “heʼll
take his death of cold.”</p>

<p>“Turn out that woman also!” He was instantly
obeyed. “Now roll up one of those
blankets, and put it under his head here&mdash;this side,
canʼt you see? Good God, what a set of fellows
you are to let a manʼs head hang down like that!
Hot water and a sponge this instant. Nearly
boiling, mind you. Plenty of it, and a foot&ndash;tub.
Now donʼt stare at me.”</p>

<p>With a quick light hand he released the blue
and turgid throat from the narrow necktie, then
laid his forefinger upon the heart and watched the
eyelids intently.</p>

<p>“Appleplexy, no doubt, master,” said the most
intelligent of the men; “I have ‘eared that if you
can bleed them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, or Iʼll phlebotomise you.”
That big word inspired universal confidence, because
no one understood it. “Now, support him
in that position, while I pull his boots off. One
of you run to the inn for a bottle of French
cognac&mdash;not this filthy stuff, mind&mdash;and a corkscrew
and a teaspoon. Now the hot water here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
In with his feet, and bathe his legs, while I sponge
his face and chest&mdash;as hot as you can bear your
hands in it. His heart is all but stopped, and his
skin as cold as ice. Thatʼs it; quicker yet! Donʼt
be afraid of scalding him. There, he begins to
feel it.”</p>

<p>The dying manʼs great heavy eyelids slowly and
feebly quivered, and a long deep sigh arose, but
there was not strength to fetch it. Dr. Hutton
took advantage of the faint impulse of life to give
him a little brandy, and then a little more again,
and by that time he could sigh.</p>

<p>“Bo,” he whispered very softly, and trying to
lift his hand for something, and Rufus Hutton
knew somehow (perhaps by means of his own child)
that he was trying to say, “Bob.”</p>

<p>“Bob will be here directly. Cheer up, cheer
up, till he comes, my friend.”</p>

<p>He called him his friend, and the very next day
he would have denounced him as murderer to the
magistrates at Lymington. Now his only thought
was of saving the poor manʼs life.</p>

<p>The fatherʼs dull eyes gleamed again when he
heard those words, and a little smile came flickering
over the stern lines of his face. They gave him
more brandy on the strength of it, while he kept
on looking at the door.</p>

<p>“Rub, rub, rub, men; very lightly, but very
quickly. Keep your thumbs up, donʼt you see?
Mustnʼt get cold again for the world. There now,
heʼll keep his heart up until his dear son arrives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
And then his children shall nurse him, much
better than any one else could; and how glad
they will be, John Thomas, to see him looking so
well and so strong again!”</p>

<p>All this time, Rue Hutton himself, with a
womanʼs skill and tenderness, was encouraging, by
gentle friction over the stagnant heart, each feeble
impulse yet to live, each little bubble faintly rising
from the well of hope, every clinging of the soul
to the things so hard to leave behind. “While
there is life, there is hope.” True and genial saying!
And we hope there is hope beyond it.</p>

<p>Poor Bull Garnet was taken home, even that
very night. For Dr. Hutton saw how much he
was longing for his children, who (until he was
carried in) knew nothing of his danger. “Please
God,” said Rufus to himself, as he crouched in the
fly by the narrow mattress, even foregoing his
loved cheroot, and keeping his hand on his patientʼs
pulse; “please God, the poor fellow shall breathe
his last with a child at either side of him.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an urgent message from Sir Cradock
Nowell was awaiting the sick man at his
cottage. Eoa herself had brought word to Pearl
(of whom she longed to make a friend) that her
uncle was walking about the house, perpetually
walking, calling aloud in every room for Mr. Garnet
and John Rosedew. He had heard of no disaster,
any more than she had, for he seldom read
the papers now; but Mr. Brockwood had been
with him a very long time that morning, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Buller came in accidentally; and Eoa could almost
vow that there was some infamous scheme on
foot, and she knew whose doing it was; and oh
that Uncle John would come back! But now they
wanted Mr. Garnet, and he must hurry up to the
Hall the moment he came home.</p>

<p>Mr. Garnet, of course, they could not have: his
strength was wrecked, his heart benumbed, his
mind incapable of effort, except to know his children,
if that could ever be one. And in this paralytic
state, never sleeping, never waking, never
wholly conscious, he lay for weeks; and time for
him had neither night nor morning.</p>

<p>But Mr. Rosedew could be brought to help his
ancient friend, if only it was in his power to overlook
the injury. He did not overlook it. For that
he was too great a man. He utterly forgot it. To
his mind it was thenceforth a thing that had never
happened:</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“To&ndash;morrow either with black cloud<br />
Let the Father fill the heaven,<br />
Or with sun full&ndash;blazing:<br />
Yet shall He not erase the past,<br />
Nor beat abroad, and make undone,<br />
What once the fleeting hour hath borne.”</p>

<p class="p1">Truly so our Horace saith. And yet that
Father gives, sometimes, to the noblest of his
children, power to revoke the evil, or at least annul
it,&mdash;grandeur to undo the wrong done by others to
them. Not with any sense of greatness, neither
hope of self&ndash;reward, simply from the loving&ndash;kindness
of the deep humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth it was a noble thing, such as not even
the driest man, sapped and carked with care and
evil, worn with undeserved rebuff, and dwelling
ever underground, in the undermining of his faith,
could behold and not be glad with a joy unbidden,
could turn away from without wet eyes, and a
glimpse of the God who loves us,&mdash;and yet the
simplest, mildest scene that a child could describe
to its mother. So will I tell it, if may be, casting
all long words away, leaning on an old manʼs staff,
looking over the stile of the world.</p>

<p>It was the height of the summer&ndash;time, and the
quiet mood of the setting sun touched with calm
and happy sadness all he was forsaking. Men
were going home from work; wives were looking
for them; maidens by the gate or paling longed
for some protection; children must be put to bed,
and what a shame, so early! Puce and purple
pillows lay, holding golden locks of sun, piled and
lifted by light breezes, the painted eider&ndash;down of
sunset. In the air a feeling was&mdash;those who
breathe it cannot tell&mdash;only this, that it does them
good; God knows how, and why, and whence&mdash;but
it makes them love their brethren.</p>

<p>The poor old man, more tried and troubled than
a lucky labourer, wretched in his wealth, worse
hampered by his rank and placement, sat upon a
high oak chair&mdash;for now he feared to lean his head
back&mdash;and prayed for some one to help him. Oh,
for any one who loved him; oh, for any sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
God, whom in his pride he had forgotten! Eoa
was a darling, his only comfort now; but what
could such a girl do? Who was she to meet the
world? And the son he had used so shamefully.
Good God, his only son! And now he knew, with
some strange knowledge, loose, and wide, and wandering,
that his son was innocent after all, and
lost to him for ever, through his own vile cruelty.
And now they meant to prove him mad&mdash;what use
to disguise it?&mdash;him who once had the clearest
head, chairman of the Quarter Sessions&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here he broke down, and lay back, with his
white hair poured against the carved black oak of
the chair, and his wasted hands flung downward,
only praying God to help him, anyhow to help
him.</p>

<p>Then John Rosedew came in softly, half
ashamed of himself, half nervous lest he were
presuming, overdrawing the chords of youth, the
bond of the days when they went about with arm
round the neck of each other. In his heart was
pity, very deep and holy; and yet, of all that filled
his eyes, the very last to show itself.</p>

<p>Over against the ancient friend, the loved one of
his boyhood, he stopped and sadly gazed a moment,
and then drew back with a shock and sorrow, as of
death brought nearer. At the sound, Sir Cradock
Nowell lifted his weary eyes and sighed; and
then he looked intently; and then he knew the
honest face, the smile, the gentle forehead. Quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
he arose, with colour flowing over his pallid cheeks,
and in his eyes strong welcome, and ready with
his lips to speak, yet in his heart unable. Thereupon
he held the chair, and bowed with the
deepest reverence, such as king or queen receives
not till a life has earned it. Even the hand
which he was raising he let fall again, drawn back
by a bitter memory, and a nervous shame.</p>

<p>But his friend of olden time would not have
him so disgraced, wanted no repentance. With
years of kindness in his eyes and the history of
friendship, he came, without a bow, and took the
hand that now was shy of him.</p>

<p>“Cradock, oh, I am so glad.”</p>

<p>“John, thank God for this, John!”</p>

<p>Then they turned to other subjects, with a sort
of nervousness&mdash;the one for fear of presuming on
pardon, the other for fear of offering it. Only both
knew, once for all, that nothing more could come
between them till the hour of death.</p>

<p>The rector accepted once again his well&ndash;beloved
home and cares, for the vacancy had not been
filled, only Mr. Pell had lived a short time at the
Rectory. The joy of all the parish equalled, if
not transcended, that of parson and of patron.</p>

<p>And, over and above the ease of conscience,
and the sense of comfort, it was a truly happy
thing for poor Sir Cradock Nowell, when the loss
of the <i>Taprobane</i> could no longer be concealed
from him, that now he had the proven friend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
fall back upon once more. He had spent whole
days in writing letters&mdash;humble, loving, imploring
letters to the son in unknown latitudes&mdash;directing
them as fancy took him to the Cape, to Port
Natal, Mozambique, or even Bombay (in case of
stress of weather), Point de Galle, Colombo, &amp;c.
&amp;c., in all cases to be called for, and invariably
marked “urgent.” Then from this labour of love
he awoke to a vague form of conviction that his
letters ought to have been addressed to the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="p2">Autumn in the Forest now, once again the
autumn. All things turning to their rest, bird,
and beast, and vegetable. Solemn and most
noble season, speaking to the soul of man, as
spring speaks to his body. The harvest of the
ample woods spreading every tint of ripeness,
waiting for the Makerʼs sickle, when His breath
is frost. Trees beyond trees, in depth and
height, roundings and massive juttings, some admitting
flaws of light to enhance their mellowness,
some very bright of their own accord, when the
sun thought well of them, others scarcely bronzed
with age, and meaning to abide the spring. It
was the same in Epping Forest, Richmond Park,
and the woods round London, only on a smaller
scale, and with less variety. And so upon his
northern road, every coppice, near or far, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
“Knockholt Beeches” (which reminded him of the
“beechen hats”), every little winding wood of
Sussex or of Surrey brought before Cradock
Nowellʼs eyes the prospect of his boyhood. He
had begged to be put ashore at Newhaven, from
the American trader, which had rescued him from
Pomona Island, and his lonely but healthful sojourn,
and then borne him to New York. Now,
with his little store of dollars, earned from the
noble Yankee skipper by the service he had rendered
him, freely given and freely taken, as
behoves two gentlemen, and with his great store
of health recovered, and recovered mind, he must
walk all the way to London, forty miles or more;
so great a desire entered into him of his native
land, that stable versatility, those free and ever&ndash;changing
skies, which all her sons abuse and love.</p>

<p>Cradock looked, I do assure you, as well, and
strong, and stout, and lusty, as may consist with
elegance at the age of two&ndash;and&ndash;twenty. And his
dress, though smacking of Broadway, “could not
conceal,” as our best writers say, “his symmetrical
proportions.” His pantaloons were of a fine bright
tan colour, with pockets fit for a thousand dollars,
and his boots full of eyelets, like big lampreys, and
his coat was a thing to be proud of, and a pleasing
surprise for Regent&ndash;street. His hat, moreover, was
umbratile, as of the Pilgrim Fathers, with a measure
of liquid capacity (betwixt the cone and the
turned&ndash;up rim) superior to that of the ordinary
cisterns of the London water&ndash;companies. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
he had not acquired the delightful hydropultic
art, distinctive of the mighty nation which
had been so kind to him. And, in spite of little
external stuff (only worthy of two glances&mdash;one to
note, and the other to smile at it), the youth was
improved in every point worth a manʼs observation.
Three months in New York had done him an
enormous deal of good; not that the place is by
any means heavenly (perhaps there are few more
hellish), only that he fell in with men of extraordinary
energy and of marvellous decision, the
very two hinges of life whereupon he (being rather
too “philosophical”) had several screws loose, and
some rust in the joints.</p>

<p>As for Wena, she (the beauty) had cocked her
tail with great arrogance at smelling English
ground again. To her straight came several dogs,
who had never travelled far (except when they
were tail&ndash;piped), and one and all cried, “Hail, my
dear! Have you seen any dogs to compare with
us? Set of mongrel parley&ndash;woos, canʼt bark or
bite like a Christian. Just look round the corner,
pretty, while we kill that poodle.”</p>

<p>To whom Wena&mdash;<i>leniter atterens caudam</i>&mdash;”Cordially
I thank you. So much now I have seen of
the world that my faith is gone in tail&ndash;wags. If
you wish to benefit by my society, bring me a bit
from the hock of bacon, or a very young marrowbone.
Then will I tell you something.” They
could not comply with her requisitions, because
they had eaten all that themselves. And so she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
trotted along the beach, like the dog of Polyphemus,
or the terrier of Hercules, who tinged his
nose with murex.</p>

<p>‘Tis a very easy thing to talk of walking fifty
miles, but quite another pair of shoes to do it;
especially with pack on back, and feet that have
lost habitual sense of Macadamʼs tender mercies.
Moreover, the day had been very warm for the
beginning of October&mdash;the dying glance of Summer,
in the year 1860, at her hitherto foregone and
forgotten England. The highest temperature of
the year had been 72° (in the month of May); in
June and July, 66° and 68° were the maxima, and
in August things were no better. Persistent rain,
perpetual chill, and ever&ndash;present sense of icebergs,
and longing for logs of dry wood. But towards
the end of September some glorious weather set in;
and people left off fires at the time when they
generally begin them. Therefore, Cradock Nowell
was hot, footsore, and slightly jaded, as he came to
the foot of Sydenham Hill, on the second day of
his journey. The Crystal Palace, which long had
been his landmark through country crossroads,
shone with blue and airy light, as the sun was
sinking. Cradock admired more and more, as
the shadows sloped along it, the fleeting gleams,
the pellucid depth, the brightness of reflection
framed by the softness of refraction.</p>

<p>He had always loved that building, and now, at
the top of the hill, he resolved (weary as he was)
to enter and take his food there. Accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Wena was left to sup and rest at the stables; he
paid the shilling that turns the wheel, and went
first to the refreshment court. After doing his
duty there, he felt a great deal better; then buttoned
his coat like a Briton, and sauntered into the
transept. It had been a high and mighty day, for
the Ancient Order of Mountaineers (who had
never seen a mountain) were come to look for one
at Penge, with sweethearts, wives, contingencies,
and continuations. It boots not now to tell their
games; enough that they had been very happy,
and were gathering back in nave and transept for
a last parade. To Cradock, so long accustomed
to sadness, solitude, and bad luck, the scene, instead
of being ludicrous (as a youth of fashion would
have found it), was interesting and impressive,
and even took a solemn aspect as the red rays of
the sun retired, and the mellow shades were deepening.
He leaned against the iron rail in front of
the grand orchestra, and seeing many pretty faces,
thought about his Amy, and wondered what she
now was like, and whether she were true to him.
From Pomona Island he could not write; from
New York he had never written; not knowing the
loss of the <i>Taprobane</i>, and fearing lest he should
seem once more to be trying the depth of John
Rosedewʼs purse. But now he was come to England,
with letters from Captain Recklesome Young,
to his London correspondents, which ensured him
a good situation, and the power to earn his own
bread, and perhaps in a little while Amyʼs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>As he leaned and watched the crowd go by, like
a dream of faces, the events of the bygone year
passed also in dark parade before him. Sad, mysterious,
undeserved&mdash;at least so far as he knew&mdash;how
had they told upon him? Had they left him
in better, or had they left him in bitter, case with
his God and his fellow&ndash;man? That question might
be solved at once, to any but himself, by the glistening
of his eyes, the gentleness of his gaze
around, the smile with which he drew back his
foot when a knickerbocked child trod on it. He
loved his fellow&ndash;creatures still; and love is law and
gospel.</p>

<p>While he thought these heavy things, feeling
weary of the road, of his life half weary, shrinking
from the bustling world again to be encountered,
suddenly a grand vibration thrilled his heart, and
mind, and soul. From the great concave above
him, melody was spreading wide, with shadowy
resistless power, like the wings of angels. The
noble organ was pealing forth, rolling to every
nook of the building, sweeping over the heads of
the people and into their hearts (with one soft
passport), “Home, sweet home!” The men who
had come because tired of home, the wives to give
them a change of it, the maidens perhaps to get
homes of their own, the children to cry to go home
again;&mdash;all with one accord stood still, all listened
very quietly, and said nothing at all about it.
Only they were the better for it, with many a kind
old memory rising, at least among the elder ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and many a large unselfish hope making the young
people look, with trust, at one another.</p>

<p>And what did Cradock Nowell feel? His home
was not a sweet one; bitter things had been done
against him; bitter things he himself had done.
None the less, he turned away and wept beneath
a music&ndash;stand, as if his heart would never give
remission to his eyes. None could see him in the
dark there, only the God whose will it was, and
whose will it often is, that tears should bring us
home to Him.</p>

<p>“I will arise, and go home to my father. I
will cry, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven,
and against thee.’”</p>

<p>And so he had. Not heavily, not wilfully, not wittingly,
not a hundredth part so badly as that father
had sinned against him. Yet it was wrong in him
not to allow the old man to recover himself, but,
forgetting a sonʼs love&ndash;duty, so to leave him&mdash;hotly,
hastily, with a proud defiance. Till now he had
never felt, or at least confessed to himself, that
wrong. Now, as generous natures do, he summed
up sternly against himself, leniently against others.
And then he asked, with yearning and bitter self&ndash;reproach,
“Is the old man yet alive?”</p>

<p class="p1">The woods were still as rich and sweet, and the
grass as soft as in May month; the windings of
the pleasant dells were looped with shining waters;
but she who used to love them so and brighten at
their freshness, to follow the steps of each wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
breeze, and call to the sun as a flower does&mdash;now
she came through her favourite places, and
hardly cared to look at them. Only three short
months ago she had returned to her woodland
home, and the folk that knew and loved her, in
the highest and brightest spirits of youth, conscious
beauty, and hopefulness. All her old
friends were rejoicing in her, and she in their
joy delighted, when her father thought it his sorrowful
duty, in this world of sorrow, to tell her
the bad news about her ever unlucky Cradock. At
first she received it with scorn&mdash;as the high manner
of her mind was&mdash;utter unbelief, because God
could not have done it. Being simple, and very
young, she had half as much faith in her heavenly
Father as she had in the earthly and fallible
parent; neither was she quite aware that we do
not buy, but accept from God.</p>

<p>But, as week upon back of week, and month
after tardy month, went by, Amyʼs faith began to
wane, and herself to languish. She watched the
arrival of every mail from the Cape, from India,
from anywhere; her heart leaped up as each
steamer came in, and sank at each empty letterbag.
Meanwhile her father was growing very
unhappy about her, and so was good Aunt Doxy.
At first John had said, when she took it so calmly,
“Thank God! How glad I am! But her mother
cared for me more than that.” Like many
another loving father, he had studied, but never
learned his child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it was the fifth day of October, the weather
bright and beautiful, the English earth and trees
and herbage trying back for the summer of which
they had been so cheated. Poor pale Amy asked
leave to go out. She had long been under Rue
Huttonʼs care, not professionally, but paternally
(for Rufus would have his own way when he was
truly fond of any one), and she asked so quietly,
so submissively, without a bit of joke about it, that
when she was gone her father set to and shook his
head, till a heavy tear came and blotted out a reference
which had taken all the morning. As for
Aunt Doxy, she turned aside, and took off her
spectacles quickly, because the optician had told
her to keep them perfectly dry.</p>

<p>Where the footpath wanders to and fro, preferring
pleasure to duty, and meeting all remonstrance
by quoting the course of the brook, Amy
Rosedew slowly walked, or heavily stopped every
now and then, caring for nothing around her.
She had made up her mind to cry no more, only
to long for the time and place when and where no
crying is. Perhaps in a year or so, if she lived,
she might be able to see things again, and attend
to her work as usual. Till then she would try to
please her father, and keep up her spirits for his
sake. Every one had been so kind to her, especially
dear Eoa, who had really cried quite steadily;
and the least thing that girl Amy could do was to
try and deserve it. Thinking thus, and doing her
best to feel as well as think it, yet growing tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
already, she sat down in a chair as soft as weary
mortal may rest in. A noble beech, with a head
of glory overlooking the forest, had not neglected
to slipper his feet with the richest of natureʼs
velvet. From the dove&ndash;coloured columnʼs base,
two yards above the ground&ndash;spread, drifts of darker
bulk began, gnarled crooks of grapple, clutching
wide at mother earth, deeply fanged into her
breast, sureties against every wind. Ridged and
ramped with many a hummock, rift, and twisted
sinew, forth these mighty tendons stretched, some
fathoms from the bole itself. Betwixt them nestled,
all in moss, corniced with the golden, and cushioned
with the greenest, nooks of cool, delicious rest,
wherein to forget the world, and dream upon the
breezes. “As You Like It,” in your lap, Theocritus
tossed over the elbow, because he is too
foreign,&mdash;what sweet depth of enjoyment for a
hard&ndash;working man who has earned it!</p>

<p>But, in spite of all this voluptuousness, the
“moss more soft than slumber,” and the rippling
leafy murmur, there is little doubt that Miss Amy
Rosedew managed to have another cry ere ever
she fell asleep. To cry among those arms of moss,
fleecing, tufting, pillowing, an absorbent even for
Niobe! Can the worn&ndash;out human nature find no
comfort in the vegetable, though it does in the
mineral, kingdom?</p>

<p>Back, and back, and further back into the old
relapse of sleep, the falling thither whence we
came, the interest on the debt of death. Yet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the old Stagyrite hints, some of dayʼs emotions
filter through the strain of sleep; it is not true
that good and bad are, for half of life, the same.
Alike their wits go roving haply after the true
Owner, but some may find Him, others fail&mdash;Father,
who shall limit thus Thine infinite
amnesty?</p>

<p>It would not be an easy thing to find a fairer
sight. Her white arms on the twisted plumage
of the deep green moss, the snowy arch of her
neck revealed as the clustering hair fell from it,
and the frank and playful forehead resting on the
soft grey bark. She smiled in her sleep every now
and then, for her pleasant young humour must
have its own way when the schoolmaster, sorrow,
was dozing; and then the sad dreaming of trouble
returned, and the hands were put up to pray, and
the red lips opened, whispering, “Come home!
Only come to Amy!”</p>

<p>And then, in her dream, he was come&mdash;raining
tears upon her cheek, holding her from all the
world, fearing to thank God yet. She was smiling
up at him; oh, it was so delicious! Suddenly
she opened her eyes. What made her face so
wet? Why, Wena!</p>

<p>Wena, as sure as dogs are dogs; mounted on
the mossy arm, lick&ndash;lick&ndash;licking, mewing like a cat
almost, even offering taste of her tongue, while
every bit of the Wena dog shook with ecstatic
rapture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Wena, Wena! what are you come to tell
me, Wena? Oh that you could speak!”</p>

<p>Wena immediately proved that she could. She
galloped round Amy, barking and yelling, until
the great wood echoed again; the rabbits, a mile
away, pricked their ears, and the yaffingales stopped
from tapping. Then off set the little dog down
the footpath. Oh, could it be to fetch somebody?</p>

<p>The mere idea of such a thing made Amy shake
so, and feel so odd, she was forced to put one hand
against the tree, and the other upon her heart.
She could not look, she was in such a state; she
could not look down the footpath. It seemed, at
least, a century, and it may have been half a
minute, before she heard through the bushes a
voice&mdash;tush, she means <i>the</i> voice.</p>

<p>“Wena, you bad dog, come in to heel. Is this
all you have learned by travelling?”</p>

<p>But Wena broke fence and everything, set off
full gallop again to Amy, tugged at her dress, and
retrieved her.</p>

<p>What happened after that Amy knows not,
neither knows Cradock Nowell. So anything I
could tell would be a fond thing vainly invented.
All they remember is&mdash;looking back upon it, as
both of them may, to the zenith of their lives&mdash;that
neither of them could say a word except
“darling, darling, darling!” all pronounced as
superlatives, with “my own,” once or twice between,
and an exclusive sense of ownership, illiberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and unphilosophical. What business have we
with such minor details? Who has sworn us
accountants of kisses? All we have any right to
say is, that after a long spell of inarticulate tautology,
Amy looked up when Cradock proposed to
add another cipher; very gravely, indeed, she
looked up; except in the deepest depth of her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh no, Cradock. You must not think of it.
Seriously now, you must <i>not</i>, love.”</p>

<p>“Why? I should like to know, indeed! After
all the time I have been away!”</p>

<p>“I have so little presence of mind. I forgot to
tell you in time, dear. Why, because Wena <i>has
licked my face all over</i>, darling. Darling, yes, she
<i>has</i>, I say. You are too bad not to care about it.
Now come to my own best father, dear. Offer
your arm like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>So they&mdash;as Milton concisely says. Homer
would have written “they two.” How sadly our
language wants a dual! We, the domestic race,
have we rejected it because the use would have
seemed a truism?</p>

<p class="p1">That same afternoon Bull Garnet lay dying,
calmly and peacefully going off, taking his accounts
to a larger world. He knew that there
were some heavy items underscored against him;
but he also knew that the mercy of God can even
outdo the hope He gives us for token and for
keepsake. A greater and a grander end, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
life of mark and power, might, to his early aspirations
and self&ndash;conscious strength, have seemed the
bourne intended. If it had befallen him&mdash;as but
for himself it would have done&mdash;to appear where
men are moved by passion, vigour, and bold decision,
his name would have been historical, and
better known to the devil. As it was, he lay
there dying, and was well content. The turbulence
of life was past, the torrent and the eddy,
the attempt at fore&ndash;reaching upon his age, and
sense of impossibility, the strain of his mental
muscles to stir the great dead trunks of “orthodoxy,”
and then the self&ndash;doubt, the chill, the
depression, which follow such attempts, as surely
as ague tracks the pioneer.</p>

<p>Thank God, all this was over now, and the
violence gone, and the dark despair. Of all the
good and evil things which so had branded him
distinct, two yet dwelled in his feeble heart, only
two still showed their presence in his dying eyes.
Each of those two was good, if two indeed they
were&mdash;faith in the heavenly Father, and love of
the earthly children.</p>

<p>Pearl was sitting on a white chair at the side of
the bed away from the window, with one hand in
his failing palm, and the other trying now and
then to enable her eyes to see things. She was
thinking, poor little thing, of what she should do
without him, and how he had been a good father
to her, though she never could understand him.
That was her own fault, no doubt. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
always fancied that he loved her as a bit of his
property, as a thing to be managed; now she
knew that it was not so; and he was going away
for ever, and who would love or manage her? And
the fault of all this was her own.</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton had been there lately, trying
still to keep up some little show of comfort, and a
large one of encouragement; for he was not the
man to say die till a patient came to the preterite.
Throughout the whole, and knowing all, he had
behaved in the noblest manner, partly from his
own quick kindness, partly from that protective
and fiduciary feeling which springs self&ndash;sown in
the hearts of women when showers of sorrow
descend, and crops up in the manly bosom at the
fee of golden sunshine. Not that he took any
fees; but that his professional habits revived,
with a generosity added, because he knew that he
would take nothing, though all were in his power.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Pell came in, our old friend Octavius,
sent for in an urgent manner, and looking
as a man looks who feels but cannot open on the
hinge of his existence. Like a thorough gentleman,
he had been shy of the cottage, although
aware of their distress; eager at once and reluctant,
partly because it stood not in his but his
rectorʼs parish, partly for deeper reasons.</p>

<p>Though Pell came in so quietly, Bull Garnet
rose at his entry, or tried to rise on the pillow,
swept his daughter back by a little motion of his
thumb, which she quite understood, and cast his
eyes on the parsonʼs with a languid yet strong intelligence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
He had made up his mind that the
man was good, and yet he could not help probing
him.</p>

<p>The last characteristic act of poor Bull Garnetʼs
life, a life which had been all character, all difference,
from other people.</p>

<p>“Will you take my daughterʼs hand, Pell?”</p>

<p>“Only too gladly,” answered Pell; but she
shrank away, and sobbed at him.</p>

<p>“Pearl, come forward this moment. It is no
time for shilly&ndash;shallying.”</p>

<p>The poor thing timidly gave her hand, standing
a long way back from Pell, and with her large eyes
streaming, yet fixed upon her father, and no chance
at all of wiping them.</p>

<p>“Now, Pell, do you love my daughter? I am
dying, and I ask you.”</p>

<p>“That I do, with all my heart,” said Pell, like a
downright Englishman. “I shall never love any
other.”</p>

<p>“Now, Pearl, do you love Mr. Pell?” Her
fatherʼs eyes were upon her in a way that commanded
truth. She remembered how she had
told a lie, at the age of seven or eight, and that
gaze had forced it out of her, and she had never
dared to tell one since, until no lie dared come
near her.</p>

<p>“Father, I like him very much. Very soon I
should love him, if&mdash;if he loved me.”</p>

<p>“Now, Pell, you hear that!”</p>

<p>“Beyond all doubt I do,” said Octave, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
dryness never deserted him in the heaviest rain of
tears; “and it is the very best thing for me I have
heard in all my life.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet looked from one to the other, with
the rally of his life come hot, and a depth of joyful
sadness. Yet must he go a little further, because
he had always been a tyrant till people understood
him.</p>

<p>“Do you want to know how much money, sir, I
intend to leave her, when I die to&ndash;night or to&ndash;morrow
morning?”</p>

<p>Cut&ndash;and&ndash;dry Pell was taken aback. A thoroughly
upright and noble fellow, but of wholly
different and less rugged road of thought. Meanwhile
Pearl had slipped away; it was more than
she could bear, and she was so sorry for Octavius.
Then Pell up and spake bravely:</p>

<p>“Sir, I would be loth to think of you, my dear
oneʼs father, as anything but a gentleman; a
strange one, perhaps, but a true one. And so I
trust you have only put such a question to me in
irony.”</p>

<p>“Pell, there is good stuff in you. I know a
man by this time. What would you think of
finding your dear oneʼs father a murderer?”</p>

<p>Octavius Pell was not altogether used to this
sort of thing. He turned away with some doubt
whether Pearl would be a desirable mother of
children (for he, after all, was a practical man),
and hereditary insanity&mdash;&mdash; Then he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
back, remembering that all mankind are mad.
Meanwhile Bull Garnet watched him, with extraordinary
wrinkles, and a savage sort of pleasure.
He felt himself outside the world, and
looking at the stitches of it. But he would not
say a word. He had always been a bully, and he
meant to keep it up.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Octave Pell, at last, “you are the
very oddest man I ever saw in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you think so, do you, Pell? Possibly you
are right; possibly you are right, Pell. I have no
time to think about it. It never struck me in
that light. If I am so very odd, perhaps you
would rather not have my daughter?”</p>

<p>“If you intend to refuse her to me, you had
better say so at once, sir. I donʼt understand all
this.”</p>

<p>“I wish you to understand nothing at all beyond
the simple fact. I shot Clayton Nowell, and did
it on purpose, because I found him insulting her.”</p>

<p>“Good God! You donʼt mean to say it?”</p>

<p>“I never yet said a thing, Pell, which I did not
mean to say.”</p>

<p>“You did it in haste? You have repented?
For Godʼs sake, tell me that.”</p>

<p>“Treat this as a question of business. Look at
the deed and nothing else. Do you still wish to
marry my daughter?”</p>

<p>Pell turned away from the great wild eyes now
solemnly fixed upon him. His manly heart was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
full of wonder, anguish, and giddy turbulence.
The promptest of us cannot always “come to time,”
like a prizefighter.</p>

<p>Pearl came in, with her chest well forward, and
then drew back very suddenly. She thought her
fate must be settled now, and would like to know
how they had settled it. Then, like a genuine
English lady, she gave a short sigh and went away.
Pride makes the difference between us and all
other nations.</p>

<p>But the dignified glance she had cast on Pell
settled his fate and hers for life. He saw her
noble self&ndash;respect, her stately reservation, her deep
sense of her own pure value (which never would
assert itself), and her passing contempt of his hesitation.</p>

<p>“At all risks I will have her,” he said to himself,
for his manly strength gloried in her strong womanhood;
“if she can be won I will have her. Oh,
how I am degrading her! What a fool&ndash;bound
fellow I am!”</p>

<p>Then he spoke to her father, who had fallen
back, and was faintly gazing, wondering what the
stoppage was.</p>

<p>“Sir, I am not worthy of her. God knows how
I love her. She is too good for me.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet gathered his fleeting life, and looked
at Pell with a love so deep that it banished admiration.
Then his failing heart supplied, for the last,
last time of all, the woe&ndash;worn fountain of his eyes.
Strong and violent as he was, a little thing had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
often touched him to the turn of tears. What
impulse is there but has this end? Even comic
laughter.</p>

<p>Pell lifted from the counterpane the broad but
shrunken hand, which was on the way to be offered
to him, until sad memory stopped it. Then he
looked down at the poor grey face, where the forehead,
from the fall of the rest, appeared almost
a monstrosity, and the waning of strong emotions
left a quivering of hollowness. The young parson
looked down with noble pity. Much he knew of
his father&ndash;in&ndash;law! Bull Garnet would never be
pitied. He drew his hand back with a little jerk,
and placed it against his broad, square chin.</p>

<p>“I canʼt bear to die like this, Pell. <i>I wish to
God you could shave me.</i>”</p>

<p>Pell went suddenly down on his knees, put his
strong brown hands up, and said nothing except
the Lordʼs Prayer. Bull Garnet tried to raise his
palms, but the power of his wrists was gone, and
so he let them fall together. Then at every grand
petition he nodded at the ceiling, as if he saw it
going upward, and thought of the lath and plaster.</p>

<p>He had said he should die at four oʼclock, for
the paroxysms of heart&ndash;complaint returned at measured
intervals, and he felt that he could not outlast
another. So with his usual mastery and
economy of labour, he had sent a man to get the
keys and begin to toll the great church bell, as
soon as ever the clock struck four. “Not too long
apart,” he said, “steadily, and be done with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>.”
When the boom of the sluggish bell came in at the
open window, Bull Garnet smiled, because the man
was doing it as he had ordered him.</p>

<p>“Right,” he whispered, “yes, quite right. I
have always been before my time. Just let me
see my children.” And then he had no more
pain.</p>

<p class="p1">Amy came in very softly, to know if he was
dead. They had told her she ought to leave it
alone, but she could not see it so. Knowing all
and feeling all, she felt beyond her knowledge.
If it would&mdash;oh, if it would help him with a
spark of hope in his parting, help him in the judgment&ndash;day,
to have the glad forgiveness of the
brother with the deeper wrong&mdash;there it was, and
he was welcome.</p>

<p>A little whispering went on, pale lips into trembling
ears, and then Cradock, with his shoes off,
was brought to the side of the bed.</p>

<p>“He wonʼt know you,” Pearl sobbed softly;
“but how kind of you to come!” She was surprised
at nothing now.</p>

<p>Her father raised his languid eyes, until they
met Cradockʼs eager ones; there they dwelt with
doubt, and wonder, and a slow rejoicing, and a last
attempt at expression.</p>

<p>John Rosedew took the wan stiffening hand,
lying on the sheet like a cast&ndash;off glove, and placed it
in Cradockʼs sunburnt palm.</p>

<p>“He knows all,” the parson whispered; “he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
read the letter you left for him; and, knowing all,
he forgives you.”</p>

<p>“That I do, with all my heart,” Cradock answered
firmly. “May God forgive me as I do
you. Wholly, purely, for once and for all!”</p>

<p>“Kind&mdash;noble&mdash;Godlike&mdash;&mdash;” the dying man
said very slowly, but with his old decision.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet could not speak again. The great
expansion of heart had been too much for its weakness.
Only now and then he looked at Cradock
with his Amy, and every look was a prayer for
them, and perhaps a recorded blessing.</p>

<p>Then they slipped away, in tears, and left him, as
he ought to be, with his children only. And the
telegraph of death was that God would never part
them.</p>

<p>Now, think you not this man was dying a great
deal better than he deserved? No doubt he was.
And, for that matter, so perhaps do most of us.
But does our Father think so?</p>

<p class="p2">Softly and quietly fell the mould on the coffin
of Bull Garnet. A great tree overhung his sleep,
without fear of the woodman. Clayton Nowellʼs
simple grave, turfed and very tidy, was only a few
yards away. That ancient tree spread forth its
arms on this one and the other, as a grandsire lays
his hands peacefully and placidly on children who
have quarrelled.</p>

<p>A lovely spot, as one might see, for violence to
rest in, for long remorse to lose the track, and deep
repentance hopefully abide the time of God. To
feel the soft mantle of winter return, and the
promising gladness of spring, the massive depths
of the summer&ndash;tide, and the bright disarray of autumn.
And to be, no more the while, oppressed,
or grieved, or overworked.</p>

<p>There shall forest&ndash;children come, joining hands
in pleasant fear, and, sitting upon grassy mounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
wonder who inhabits them, wonder who and what
it is that cannot wonder any more. And haply
they shall tell this tale&mdash;become a legend then&mdash;when
he who writes, and ye who read, are dust.</p>

<p>Ay, and tell it better far, more simply, and
more sweetly, never having gone astray from the
inborn sympathy. For every grown&ndash;up man is apt
to mar the uses of his pen with bitter words, and
small, and twaddling; conceiting himself to be keen
in the first, just in the second, and sage in the
third. For all of these let him crave forgiveness
of God, his fellow&ndash;creatures, and himself, respectively.</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell, still alive to the normal
sense of duty, tottered away on John Rosedewʼs
arm, from the grave of his half&ndash;brother. He had
never learned whose hand it was that dug the
grave near by, and no one ever forced that unhappy
knowledge on him. This last blow, which
seemed to strike his chiefest prop from under him,
had left its weal on his failing mind in great marks
of astonishment. That such a strong, great man
should drop, and he, the elder and the weaker, be
left to do without him! He was going to the
Rectory now, to have a glass of wine, after fatigue
of the funeral, a vintage very choice and rare,
according to Mr. Rosedew, and newly imported
from Oxford. And truly that was its origin. It
might have claimed “founderʼs kin fellowship,”
like most of the Oxford wine&ndash;skins.</p>

<p>“Wonderful, wonderful man!” said poor Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Cradock, doing his best to keep his back very upright,
from a sudden suffusion of memory,&mdash;”to
think that he should go first, John! Oh, if I
had a son left, he should take that man for his
model.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely that,” John Rosedew thought, knowing
all the circumstances; “but of the dead I will
say no harm.”</p>

<p>“So quick, so ready, so up for anything! Ah,
I remember he knocked a man down just at the
corner by this gate here, where the dandelion&ndash;seed
is. And afterwards he proved how richly he deserved
it. That is the way to do things, John.”</p>

<p>“I am not quite sure of that,” said the conscientious
parson; “it might be wiser to prove
that first; and then to abstain from doing it. I
remember an instance in point&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course you do. You always do, John, and
I wish you wouldnʼt. But that has nothing to do
with it. You are always cutting me short, John;
and worse than ever since you came back, and
they talked of you so at Oxford. I hope they
have not changed you, John.”</p>

<p>He looked at the white&ndash;haired rector, with an
old manʼs jealousy. Who else had any right to
him?</p>

<p>“My dear old friend,” replied John Rosedew,
with kind sorrow in his eyes, “I never meant to
cut you short. I will try not to do it again. But
I know I am rude sometimes, and I am always
sorry afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, John; donʼt talk of it. I understand
you by this time; and we allow for one
another. But now about my son, my poor unlucky
boy.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, yes,” said the other old man, not
wishing to hurry matters. And so they stopped
and probed the hedge instead of one another.</p>

<p>“I donʼt know how it is,” at last Sir Cradock
Nowell said, being rather aggrieved with John
Rosedew for not breaking ground upon him&mdash;”but
how hard those stubs of ash are! Look at
that splinter, almost severed by a man who does
not know how to splash; Jem, his name is, poor
Garnet told me, Jem&mdash;something or other&mdash;and
yet all I can do with my stick wonʼt fetch it away
from the stock.”</p>

<p>“Like a child who will not quit his father, however
his father has treated him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, John? Are
you driving at me again? I thought you had given
it over.”</p>

<p>“I never give over anything,” John answered,
in a manner for him quite melodramatic, and beyond
his usual key.</p>

<p>“No. We always knew how stubborn you were.
And now you are worse than ever.”</p>

<p>“No fool like an old fool,” John Rosedew answered,
smiling sweetly, yet with some regret.
“Cradock, I am such a fool I shall let out everything.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Sir Cradock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Nowell, leaning heavily on his staff, and setting
his white face rigidly, yet with every line of it
ready to melt; “John, I have heard strange rumours,
or I have dreamed strange dreams. In the
name of God, what is it, John? My son!&mdash;my
only son&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He could say no more, but turned away, and
bowed his head, and trembled.</p>

<p>“Your only son, your innocent son, has been at
my house these three days; and when you like,
you can see him.”</p>

<p>“When I like&mdash;ah, to be sure! I donʼt like
many people. I am getting very old, John. And
no one to come after me. It seems a pity, donʼt
you think, and every one against me so?”</p>

<p>“You can take your own part still, my friend.
And you have to take your sonʼs part.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure, my sonʼs part. Perhaps he will
come back some day. And I know he did not do
it, now; and I was very hard to him&mdash;donʼt you
think I was, John?&mdash;very hard to my poor Craddy,
and he was so like his mother!”</p>

<p>“But you will be very kind to him now; and
he will be such a comfort to you, now he is come
back again, and going away no more.”</p>

<p>“I declare you make me shake, John. You do
talk such nonsense. One would think you knew
all about him,&mdash;more than his own father does.
What have I done, to be kept like this in the dark,
all in the dark? And you seem to think that I
was hard to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Cradock, all you have to do is just to say the
word; just to say that you wish to see him, and
your son will come and talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Talk to me! Oh yes, I should like to talk to
him&mdash;very much&mdash;I mean, of course, if he is at
leisure.”</p>

<p>He leaned on his stick, and tried to think, while
John Rosedew hurried off; and of all his thoughts
the foremost were, “What will Cradock my boy
be like; and what shall I give him for dinner?”</p>

<p>Cradock came up shyly, gently, looking at his
father first, then waiting to be looked at. The old
man fixed his eyes upon him, at first with some astonishment&mdash;for
his taste in dress was somewhat
outraged by the Broadway style&mdash;then, in spite of
all the change, remembrance of his son returned,
and love, and sense of ownership. Last of all,
auctorial pride in the young manʼs width of shoulder,
blended with soft recollections of the time he
dandled him.</p>

<p>“Why, Cradock! It is my poor son Cradock!
What a size you are grown, my boy, my boy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, I am sure you want me. Only try
me once again. I am not at all a radical.”</p>

<p>“Crad, you never could be. I knew you must
come round at last to my way of thinking. When
you had seen the world, Crad; when you had
seen the world a bit, as your father did before
you.”</p>

<p>And so they made the matter up, in politics,
and dress, and little touches of religion, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the depth of kindred love which underlies the
latter; and never after was there word, except of
migrant petulance, between the crotchety old man,
and the son who held his heartʼs key.</p>

<p>All this while we have been loth to turn to Mrs.
Corklemore, and contemplate her discomfiture,
although in strict sequence of events we ought to
have done so long ago. But it is so very painful&mdash;and
now&ndash;a&ndash;days all writers agree with Epicurus,
in regarding pain as the worst of evils&mdash;so bitter
is the task to describe a lovely mother failing, in
spite of all exertion, to do her duty by her child,
in robbing other people, that really&mdash;ah well&ndash;a&ndash;day,
physic must be taken.</p>

<p>At the time of her dismissal from the halls of
Nowelhurst, Mr. Corklemore had been so glad to
see his pretty wife again, and that queer little
Flore, who amused him so by pinching his stiff
leg, and crying “haw,” and he had found the
house so desolate, and the absence of plague so
unwholesome, and the responsibility of having a
will of his own so horrible, that he scarcely cared
to ask the reason why they were come home. And
Georgie&mdash;who was not thoroughly heartless, else
how could she have got on so?&mdash;thought Coo Nest
very snug and nice, with none to contradict her.
So she found relief awhile, in banishing her worse,
while she indulged her better half.</p>

<p>Let me do the same by suppressing here that
evil tendency to moralise. In Georgieʼs case, as
well as mine, the indulgence possessed at any rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the attractions of change and variety. But, knowing
how strictly we are bound by the canons of
philosophy to suspect and put the curb on every
natural bias, that good young woman soon refrained
from over&ndash;active encouragement of her inclination
to goodness. Rallying her sense of right, she vanquished
very nobly all the seductions of honesty,
and, by a virtuous effort, marched from the Capua
of virtue.</p>

<p>She stood upon the wood&ndash;crowned heights which
look upon Coo Nest, and as the smoke came
curling up, the house seemed very small to her.
What a thing to call a garden! And the pigeon&ndash;house
at Nowelhurst was nearly as large as our
stable! And oh that little vinery, where one
knew every single bunch, and came every day
to watch its ripening, and the little fuss of its
colouring, like an ogre watching a pet babe roasting.
Surely nature never meant her to live upon
so small a scale; or why had she been gifted with
such large activities?</p>

<p>She turned her back upon Coo Nest, and her
face to Nowelhurst Hall, and in her mindʼs eye
saw a place ever so much larger.</p>

<p>Then a pleasant sound came up the hollow, a
nice ring of revolving wheels coquetting with the
best C springs and all the new improvements.
Well&ndash;mettled horses, too, were there, stepping together
sonipedally, and a footman could be seen,
whose legs must stand him in 60<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p>“That odious old Sir Julius Wallop and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
wizen&ndash;faced wife come to patronize us again and
say, ‘Ha, Corklemore, snug little place, charming
situation; but I think I should pull it down and
rebuild; no room for Chang to stand in it. And
how is my old friend, Sir Cradock, your forty&ndash;fifth
cousin, I believe? Ah, he <i>has</i> a nice place.’
I havenʼt the heart to meet them now, and their
patronizing disparagement. Heigho! It is a nice
turn&ndash;out. And yet they have at Nowelhurst three
more handsome carriages. And it does look so
much better to have two footmen there behind;
and I do like watered linings so. How nice Flo
did look by my side in that new barouche! Oh,
my darling child, I must not give way to selfish
feelings. I must do my duty towards you.”</p>

<p>Therefore she proceeded, against her better
nature, in the face of prudence, with her attempt
to set aside poor Sir Cradock Nowell, and obtain
fiduciary possession of his property. Cradock
was lost in the <i>Taprobane</i>,&mdash;of that there could
be no doubt; and so she was saved all further
trouble of laying before the civil authorities the
stronger evidence they required before issuing a
warrant. But all was going very nicely towards
the commencement of an inquiry as to the old
manʼs state of mind. Then suddenly she was
checkmated, and never moved a pawn again.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Mrs. Corklemore was sitting in
her drawing&ndash;room, expecting certain visitors, and
quite ready to be bored with them, because they
were leading gossips&mdash;ladies who gave the first complexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to any nascent narrative. And Georgie
knew how to handle them. In the county talk
which must ensue, only let them take her side, and
all the world would feel for her in her very painful
position.</p>

<p>After a rumble of rapid wheels, and a violent
pull at the bell, which made the lady of the house
to jump, because they had just had the bell&ndash;hanger,
into her sanctuary came with a cooler than
curcumine temperature, not indeed Lady Alberta
Smith and her daughter Victorina Beatrice, but
Eoa Nowell and her cousin Cradock.</p>

<p>For once in her life Mrs. Corklemore was deprived
of all presence of mind, ghostly horror being
added to bodily fear of Eoa. She fain would have
fled, but her limbs gave way, and she fell back
into a soft French chair, and covered her face with
both hands. Then Eoa, looking tall and delicate
in her simple mourning dress, walked up to her
very quietly, leading Cradock as if she were proud
of him.</p>

<p>“I have taken the liberty, Mrs. Corklemore, of
bringing my cousin Cradock to see you, because it
may save trouble.”</p>

<p>“I trust you will forgive,” said Cradock, “our
very sudden invasion. We are come upon a matter
of business, to save unpleasant exposures and disgrace
to our distant relatives.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” gasped poor Mrs. Corklemore, “you are
alive, then, after all? It was proved that you had
lost your life upon the coast of Africa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it has proved otherwise,” Cradock
answered, bowing neatly.</p>

<p>“And it would have been so much better, under
the sad, sad circumstances, for all people of good
feeling, and all interested in the family.”</p>

<p>“For the latter, perhaps it would, madam; but
not so clearly for the former. I am here to protect
my father from all machinations.”</p>

<p>“Leave her to me,” cried Eoa, slipping prettily
in front of him, “I understand her best, because&mdash;because
of my former vocation. And I think she
knows what I am.”</p>

<p>“That I do,” answered Georgie, cleverly interposing
first a small enamelled table; “not only
an insolent, but an utterly reckless creature.”</p>

<p>“You may think so,” Eoa replied, with calm
superiority; “but that only shows your piteous
ignorance of the effects of discipline. I am now
so sedate and tranquil a woman, that I do not hate,
but scorn you.”</p>

<p>Cradock could not help smiling at this, knowing
what Eoa was.</p>

<p>“We want no strong expressions, my dear, on
one side or the other,” for he saw that a word
would have overthrown Eoaʼs new&ndash;born discipline;
“Mrs. Corklemore is far too clever not to perceive
her mistake. She knows quite well that any inquiry
as to my dear fatherʼs state of mind can now
be of no use to her. And if she thinks of any
further proceedings against myself, perhaps she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
had better first look at just this&mdash;just this document.”</p>

<p>He laid before her a certificate, granted by three
magistrates, that indisputable evidence had been
brought before them as to the cause and manner
of Clayton Nowellʼs death, and that Cradock
Nowell had no share in it, wittingly or unwittingly.
That was the upshot of it; but of course it extended
to about fifty&ndash;fold the length.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore bent over her, in her most bewitching
manner, and perused it very leisurely, as
if she were examining Floreʼs attempts at pothooks.
Meanwhile, with a side&ndash;glint of her eyes, she was
watching both of them; and it did not escape her
notice that Eoa was very pale.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” she said at last, looking full at
the Eastern maid, “I see exactly how it was. I
have thought so all along. A female Thug must
be charmed, of course, by the only son of a murderer.
My dear, I do so congratulate you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Eoa, and the deep gaze
of her lustrous eyes made the clever woman feel a
world unopened to her; “I thank you, Georgie
Corklemore, because you know no better. My
only wish for you is, that you may never know
unhappiness, because you could not bear it.”</p>

<p>Saying so, she turned away, and, with her light,
quick step, was gone, before her enemy could see a
symptom of the welling tears which then burst all
control. But Cradock, who had dwelt in sorrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
compared to which hers was a joke, stayed to say
a few soft words, and made a friend for evermore
of the woman who had plotted so against his life
and all his love.</p>

<p>Madame la Comtesse since that time has seen
much tribulation, and is all the better for it. Mr.
Corklemore died of the gout, and the angel Flore
of the measles; and she herself, having nursed
them both, and lost some selfishness in their graves,
is now (as her destiny seemed to be) the wife of
Mr. Chope. Of course she is compelled to merge
her strong will in a stronger one, and, according
to natureʼs Salique law, is the happier for doing
so. Whether this union will produce a subject for
biography to some unborn Lord Campbell, time
alone can show.</p>

<p>From the above it will be clear that poor Eoa
Nowell was now acquainted with the secret of the
Garnet family. Bob himself had told her all,
about a month after his fatherʼs death, renouncing
at the same time all his claims upon her. Of that
Eoa would not hear; only at his urgency she promised
to consult her friends, and take a week to
think of it. And this was the way she kept her
promise.</p>

<p>First she ran up to Cradock Nowell, with the
bright tears still upon her cheeks, and asked him
whether he had truly and purely forgiven his injurer.
He took her hand, and answered her with
his eyes, in which the deepened springs of long
affliction glistened, fixed steadily upon hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“As truly and purely as I hope to be forgiven
at the judgment&ndash;day.”</p>

<p>“Then that settles that matter. Now order the
dog&ndash;cart, Crady dear, and drive me to Dr.
Huttonʼs.”</p>

<p>Of course he obeyed her immediately, and in an
hour they entered the gate of Geopharmacy Lodge.
Rosa was amazed at her beauty, and thought very
little, after that, of Mrs. Corklemoreʼs appearance.</p>

<p>“For my part,” said Rufus Hutton, when Eoa
had laid the case before him in a privy council,
“although it is very good of you, and very flattering
to me, that you look upon me still as your
guardian, I think you are bound first of all to
consult Sir Cradock Nowell.”</p>

<p>“How very odd! Now that is exactly what I
do not mean to do. He never can understand,
poor dear, and I hope he never will, the truth
about poor Claytonʼs death. His present conviction
is, like that of all the neighbourhood, that
Black Will the poacher did it, the man who has
since been killed in a fight with Sir Julius Wallopʼs
gamekeepers. And it would shock poor uncle so;
I am sure he would never get over it if the truth
were forced upon him. And if it were, I am sure
he would never allow me to have my way, which,
of course, I should do in spite of him. And I am
not his heiress now, since Cradock came to life
again. But I have plenty of money of my
own; and I have quite settled what to give him
the day that I am married, and you too, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
dear guardy, if you behave well about this. Look
here!”</p>

<p>She drew forth a purse quite full of gold, and
tossed it in her old Indian style, so that Rufus
could not help laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” he answered kindly, “who
could resist such bribery? Besides, I see that your
mind is made up, and we all know what the result
of that is. And after all, the chief question is,
what effect will your knowledge of this have on
your love for your husband?”</p>

<p>“It will only make me love him more, ever so
much more, because of his misfortune.”</p>

<p>“And will you never allude to it, never let him
see that you think of it, so as to spoil his happiness?”</p>

<p>“Is it likely I should think of it? Why, my
father must have killed fifty men. He was desperate
in a battle. And Bob has never brought that
up against me.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you take it in that light&mdash;decidedly
not an English light&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And perhaps you never heard that Bobʼs father,
by his quickness and boldness, saved the lives of
fifteen men in a colliery explosion before he ever
came to Nowelhurst, and therefore he had a perfect
right to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Take the lives of fifteen others. Fourteen to
his credit still. Well, Eoa, you can argue, if any
female in the world can. Only in one thing, my
dear child, be advised by me. If you must marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Robert Garnet, leave this country for a while, and
take his sister Pearl with you.”</p>

<p>“Of course I must marry Bob,” said Eoa; “and
of course I should go away with him. But as to
taking Pearl with us, why, thatʼs a thing to be
thought about.”</p>

<p>However, they got over that, as well as all other
difficulties; Sir Cradock Nowell was at the wedding,
Mr. Rosedew performed the ceremony, and
Rufus Hutton gave away as lovely a bride as ever
was seen. Bob Garnet spied a purple emperor,
who had lost his way, knocking his head in true
imperial fashion against the chancel&ndash;window, and
he glanced at Eoa about it, between the two “I
wills,” and she lifted her beautiful eyebrows, and
he saw that she meant to catch him. So, after
signing the register, they contrived to haul him
down, without letting John Rosedew know it;
then at the chancel&ndash;porch they let him go free of
the Forest, with his glorious wings unsoiled. Not
even an insect should have cause to repent their
wedding&ndash;day.</p>

<p>And now they live in as fair a place as any the
world can show, not far from Pezo da Ragoa, in
the Alto Douro district. There Eoaʼs children
toddle by the brilliant riverʼs brink, and form their
limbs to strength and beauty up the vine&ndash;clad
mountainʼs side. Bob has invested his share of
proceeds in a vineyard of young Bastardo, and
Muscat de Jesu; moreover, he holds a good appointment
under the Royal Oporto Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
agricultural of the vine. Many a time Eoa sits
watching with her deep bright eyes the purple
flow of the luscious juice from the white marble
“lagar,” wherein the hardy peasants, with their
drawers tied at the knee, tramp to the time of the
violin to and fro, without turning round, among
the pulpy flood. Then Bob, who has discovered a
perfect cure for oidium, and knows how to deal
with every grub that bores into or nips the vine,
to his wife and bairns he comes in haste, having
been too long away, bringing a bunch of the
“ladiesʼ fingers,” or the Barrete de Clerigo, or it may
be some magnificent insect new to his entomology;
or, still more interesting prize, a letter from Pearl
or Amy, wherein Mrs. Pell, or Nowell, gossips of
the increasing cares which increase her happiness.
Yet even among those lovely scenes, and under
that delicious sky, frequent and fond are the
glances cast by hope, as well as memory, at the
bowered calm of the Forest brooks, and the brown
glamour of the beechwood.</p>

<p>And when they return to dwell in the Forest,
and to end their days there, even Bob will scarcely
know the favourite haunts of his boyhood&mdash;to such
an extent has Cradock Nowell planted and improved,
clothing barren slopes with verdure, adding
to the wealth of woods many a new tint and tone,
by the aid of foreign trees unknown to his father.
In doing so, his real object is not so much to improve
the estate, or gratify his own good taste, or
even that of Amy; but to find labour for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
hands, and food for the mouths, of industrious
people. Sir Cradock grumbles just a little every
now and then, because, like all of us Englishmen,
he must have his grievance. But, on the whole,
he is very proud of what his son is doing, and
thoroughly enjoys his power of urging or repressing
it.</p>

<p>And if on theoretic matters any question chances
to arise between them, when one says “no” to the
otherʼs “yes”&mdash;as all true Britons are bound to do
upon politics, port wine, and parsons,&mdash;then a
gentle spirit comes and turns it all to laughter,
with the soft and pleasant wit of a well&ndash;bred
womanʼs ignorance. For Amy still must have her
say, and still asserts her privilege to flavour every
dull discussion with lively words, and livelier
glances, and a smile for both the disputants.
Then Cradock looks at his dear young wife with
notes of admiration, and bids her keep such
piquant wisdom for the councils of the nursery.
Upon which pleasant reminder, the old man
chuckles, as if some very good thing had been
said; then craftily walks with a spotted toy, capable
of barking and exactly representing Caldo
or Wena, whichever you please, to the foot of certain
black oak&ndash;stairs, where he fully expects to hear
the prattle of small Clayton.</p>

<p>To wit, it has been long resolved, and managed
with prospective wisdom down the path of years,
that the county annals shall not be baulked of a
grand Sir Clayton Nowell. And a very grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
fellow indeed he is, this two&ndash;year&ndash;old Clayton
Nowell&mdash;grand in the stolid sageness of his broad
and steadfast gaze, grand in the manner of his legs
and his Holbein attitude, grander still in stamping
when his meat and ale are late, but grandest of all,
immeasurably grand, in the eyes of his grandfather.</p>

<p>Hogstaff, whose memory is quite gone, and his
hearing too of every sound except the voice of this
boy, identifies him beyond all cavil with the Clayton
of our story. Many a time the bowed retainer
chides his little master for not remembering the
things he taught him only yesterday. Then Cradock
smiles at his sonʼs oblivion of the arts his
uncle learned, but never reminds old Hoggy that
the yesterday was rather more than five&ndash;and&ndash;twenty
years ago.</p>

<p>Is it true or is it false, according to the rules of
art, that the winding&ndash;up of a long, long story,
handled with more care than skill, should have
some resemblance to the will of a kindly&ndash;natured
man? In whose final dispositions, no dependent,
however humble, none who have helped him in the
many pages of his life, far less any intimate friend,
seeks in vain a grateful mention or a token of
regard.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, any writer who loves his work
(although a fool for doing so) feels the end and
finish of it like the signature of his will. And
doubly saddened must he be, if the scenes which
charmed him most, and cast upon him such a spell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that he could not call spectators in,&mdash;if these, for
want of skill, have wearied eyes and hearts he
might have pleased.</p>

<p>For surely none would turn away, whose nature
is uncancelled, if once he could be gently led into
that world of beauty. To rest in the majesty of
shade, forgetting weary headache; to let the little
carking cares, avarice and jealousy, self&ndash;conceit and
thirst of fame, fly away on the wild wood, like the
piping of a bird; to hear the rustle of young leaves,
when their edges come together, and dreamily to
wonder at the size of things above us.</p>

<p>Shall ever any man enclasp the good that grows
above him, or even offer to receive the spread of
Heavenʼs greatness? Yet every man may lift himself
above the highest tree&ndash;tops, even to the throne
of God, by loving and forgiving.</p>

<p>And verily, some friends of ours, who could not
once forego a grudge, are being taught, by tare
and trett, how much they owe their Maker, and
how little to themselves. First of these is Rufus
Hutton, quite a jolly mortal, getting fat, and riding
Polly for the sake of his liver and renes. And all
he has to say is this: first, that he will match
trees and babies with those of any nurseryman;
next, that as I have a knack of puffing good people
and good things, he begs for reciprocity on the part
of superior readers. And if this should chance to
meet the eye of any one who knows where to find
a really first&ndash;rate Manilla, conducted on free&ndash;trade
principles, such knowing person, by addressing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
confidentially under seal, “R. H., Post&ndash;office,
Ringwood,” may hear of something very greatly
to his own advantage.</p>

<p>Now do we, without appeal to the blue smoke
of enthusiasm, know of anything to the advantage
of anybody whatever? Yes, I think we do. We
may highly commend the recent career of the
Ducksacre firm, and Mr. Clinkers, and Issachar
Jupp the bargee. Robert Clinkers and Polly his
wife are driving a first&ndash;rate business in coal and
coke and riddlings, not highly aristocratic perhaps,
but free from all bad debts. You may see
the name on a great brass&ndash;plate near the Broadway,
Hammersmith, on the left hand, where the
busses stop. But Mr. Jupp flies at higher game.
He has turned his length of wind, that once secured
the palm of victory in physical encounters,
to a higher and nobler use. In a word, Mr.
Jupp is a Primitive Christian upon and beside
the waters of Avon. There you may hear him
preaching and singing through his nose alternately&mdash;ah,
me, that is not what I mean&mdash;for either
proceeding is nasal&mdash;every Sunday and Wednesday
evening, when the leaks in the punt allow
him. He gets five&ndash;and&ndash;thirty shillings a&ndash;week, as
Sir Cradockʼs water&ndash;bailiff, and he has not stolen
twig or catkin of all the trees he convoys down
Avon. In seven or eight more summers, little
Loo Jupp will probably be the prettiest girl in
the Forest. May we be there to see her!</p>

<p>The best and kindest man of all who have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
their say in my story, and not thrust their merits
forward, John Rosedew, still leads his quiet life,
nearer and nearer to wisdomʼs threshold, nearer
and nearer to the door of God. His temper is as
soft and sweet, his memory as bright and ready,
and his humour as playful, as when he was only
thirty years old, and walked every day to Kidlington.
As for his shyness, that we must never
ask him to discard; because he likes to know us
first, and then he likes to love us.</p>

<p>But of all the people in the world, next to his
own child Amy, most he loves and most he honours
his son&ndash;in&ndash;law, Cradock Nowell&mdash;</p>

<p>Cradock Nowell, so enlarged and purified by
affliction, so able now to understand and feel for
every poor man. He, when placed in large possessions
and broad English influence, never will
forget the time of darkness, grief, and penury,
never will look upon his brethren, as under another
God than his.</p>

<p>It is true that we must have hill and valley,
towering oak and ragged robin, zenith cloud overlooking
the sun, and mist crouching down in the
hollows. And true as well that we cannot see all
the causes and needs of the difference. But is it
not still more true and sure, that the whole is of
one universal kingdom (bound together by one
great love), the high and low, the rich and poor,
the powerful and the helpless? And in the spreading
of that realm, beyond the shores of time and
space, when at last it is understood what the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
aim of this life has been, not greatness, honour,
wealth, or science, no, nor even wisdom&mdash;as we
unwisely take it&mdash;but happiness here and hereafter,
a flowing tide whose fountain is our love of
one another, then shall we truly learn by feeling
(whereby alone we can learn) that all the cleaving
of our sorrow, and cuts into the heart of us, were
nothing worse than preparation for the grafts of
God.</p>
